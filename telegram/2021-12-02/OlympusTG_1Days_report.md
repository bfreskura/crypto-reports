    @Ap0l1o --- *The website has some small issues with the web3 provider, at the moment Metamask is a better option.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/101557)

    @AMA_RILDO --- *Guys doesn’t make sense talk about more investments in OHM when almost all the people that staked can’t see their balance anymore. They said about an issue, well nobody can says what is really going to happen and it’s pretty hard to talk even about “trust” until I’ll not able to the what I just invested so far. Just a logic though.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/102535)

2. **gohm avax**

    @CrypticFrank --- *Woah. Ok thats why the rebases are baked into the index. So as the index goes up for the network, my gOHM increases in value regardless of where I keep it? So I could hodl and just keep gOHM in my wallet and I’ll still collect rebases? Or does it need to be staked somewhere to be able to collect the rebases?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/100158)

    @ParamedicOne --- *Yeah but you need to convert your sOHM into gOHM for V2* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/100122)

    @Miguel_ecu --- *gOHM is wsOHM but new contract* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/100106)

    @Jaime799 --- *Wen gohm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/98813)

    @Ap0l1o --- *we have some website issues with our web3 provider, we are working on a fix* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/101216)

    @wagmicrypto --- *It looks like our website has a minor issue with a web3 provider so for now, use Metamask as opposed to Trust Wallet. We are hard at work to provide a fix. If you face with any other errors on the website, feel free to report it to our mods.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/100997)
