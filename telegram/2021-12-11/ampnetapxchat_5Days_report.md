    @Domy177 --- *I haven't stopped by for some time and just now I'm seeing this Pontoon dao news. It looks like Pontoon dao will likely have it's own token and if that turns out to be the case, what will be utility of native ampnet token, what will be ones reason to buy native ampnet token?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35541)
