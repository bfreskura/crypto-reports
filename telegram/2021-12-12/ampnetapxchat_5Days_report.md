1. **address wrong**

    @mislavjavor --- *@pin_doll we have said we don't refund funds accidentaly sent to the deployer... We are willing to make an exception for you and a couple of others, but it's very low on the priority list for us. Your message was deleted because you accused us of stealing.   We have received over 1000 ETH in value during the fundraise, there is really no motive to steal 1 ETH from you or 300 USDC from some other person or 1000 USDT from a third person. The fact is, you sent the funds to the wrong address - it's our good will to refund them.   Which we will do, when we get to it - and no sooner.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35637)

6. **horrible pontoon**

    @Domy177 --- *I haven't stopped by for some time and just now I'm seeing this Pontoon dao news. It looks like Pontoon dao will likely have it's own token and if that turns out to be the case, what will be utility of native ampnet token, what will be ones reason to buy native ampnet token?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35541)

    @E_Don --- *Will there be an airdrop of pontoon to AAPX holders?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35623)

    @<UNK> --- *We are still considering new token for DAO, but if there is one, it wont be airdropped, rather AAPX holders will stake the tokens to farm Pontoon token* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35624)

    @runex_x1 --- *Good luck to the team with pontoon. I really hope it takes off. Comparing it to klimadao (with illiquid carbon bonds), this has to be the way :). Just hope you also provide pool-liquidity on polygon somehow.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35560)
