1. **market really**

    @Finn_jan --- *Panic sellers just want quick profits and they will try to manipulate you(..Bitcoin will drop lower, I’m just selling to buy more, correction time…). They don’t care about you at all. If they begging you to sell it’s because they’ve already sold, they usually come up suddenly from nowhere. If you believe in the project hold and think in long term whatever happens, it will worth it.  Panic sellers are gambling and soon they will get wrecked by the market. Market always goes up and down. Be patient if it’s not your first time in cryptocurrency you will know that. If you are patient and self informed you will do hold, Compound is a huge project. In other way those panic sellers will take your investment ND you will regret* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/23371)
