    @Ford_Probe1 --- *The MarketCap displayed on your page does not match. The amount is completely different, because you should calculate the real MarketCap with the Circulation Supply. Where can we adjust this? In the "Self-Report" section, we have already done that. We have also already filled out all the appropriate forms for this. We would be grateful for some good advice  We have seen other projects that had the problem with the total supply, but on your site their self report original market capitalization is displayed, on our site it was also displayed but it is gone again.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/309566)
