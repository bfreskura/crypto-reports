    @hahmed812 --- *So I have a general question, is cardano in its current state able to match Ethereum as a "world computer". Like from a solidity developers perspective are their any restrictions on the cardano platform that could prevent us from coding in slightly data intensive smart contracts such as whitelisting STO etc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758309)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *you are actually not staking, you are lending your coins to that platform for the time your coins are locked, and they are doing what they want with your coins. after the lock period passes, they are giving you back your coins + interest.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758330)

    @glitch04 --- *This is not a place for pool advertisement so the best place would be check in #marketplace or use other social platforms to gather a list* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/757703)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *that is not Cardano delegating, when you have to keep the coins in their platform. that is something specific to that platform.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758328)

    @Dread_Poet_Sobriety --- *There is no ETH killer. These platforms will co-exist.  It is a layer 1 platform. Polygon is a layer 2.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758019)

    @Mads --- *Does a stablecoin like Djed need to be pegged to a fiat currency? Or could you peg it to something in the natural world fx. Number of rainy days in Germany or size of forest in Brazil?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758443)

    @jaypatelEarthling --- *You can mostly sell with service Yoroi provide via third party but i recommend using which is local and famous so it can get directly to your bank account in fiat* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758225)

    @Juanlot --- *https://www.cardanocube.io/ here you can see the other stable coins* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758444)

    @You --- *Hello hello I am wondering if there is a quicker way to see what stake pools are doing with rewards (charity, interesting projects, etc), than going to each ones website and searching it out.  Is there some kind of categorizer in action somewhere? There are too many to be worth spending all that time.   If my only interest is returns, than it doesn’t matter, but if Im more interested in what its contributing to, then its more important.   Is there a quicker way?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/757823)

    @glitch04 --- *it's actually better to move the funds directly to the new wallet you still have 2 pending epochs in your original by that time the new wallet would be returning the full rewards and you miss no rewards by having an extended delay* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758186)

    @Katsumot0 --- *Hence the long synch times, sometimes. But it Depends though, if you have a relatively new pc with 16+gb ram then it shouldn’t be too bad.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/757971)

8. **spendable**

    @glitch04 --- *That's how you "claim" the rewards to make them spendable* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758198)
