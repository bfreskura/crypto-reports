10. **incentive**

    @S0T0SHI --- *Hello guys.  I was thinking about creating an NFT and selling it at a cheap price on the market, like $20... and then I thought of giving an incentive to buy my nft... for example, if the person buys my nft , he gets back about $10 in some other cryptocurrency like polygon, avalanche, cardano... what do you think?  Do you think it would be a good incentive?  It would be like a cashback. Do you think it's a good idea?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/408222)
