1. **prompt**

    @p --- *I got this prompt above when trying to log in with the trezor device.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758613)

    @p --- *Hey guys. I have some issue withdrawing and restaking ada on Yoroi. I’m using my Trezor T for my yoroi wallet and I transferred Ada into it 2 months ago, delegated it with no issue. Now I’m trying to redelegate it to a different pool and a message pops up on my Trezor, saying “change address payment credential is a path…” then when i tick the checkmark, it takes me to another prompt saying “change address staking credential is a key hash…” then to another prompt of a sum of my account minus the amount I’m trying to withdraw before taking me to the standard signing off that fails to go through. I’ve noticed the same problem on the forums in a few cases but there seems to be no definitive solution for this. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758585)

3. **multiple nft**

    @p --- *I tried. But when i try to use the recovery phrase on adalite it shows that my wallet has 0 balance. I’m sure this is the only set of seedphrase i have because I only have the one cardano wallet and I only wrote down one set of it. Checked it multiple times. The balance on yoroi and cardanoscan is correct tho* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758603)
