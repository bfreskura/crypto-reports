1. **aorora**

    @angusmcmangus --- *I’ve just recently heard about Near and I’m interested in investigating my this further. However I don’t really understand how Aorora helps Near though. I understand that Aorora is built on Nears tech. However if Aorora became really popular would that actually translate into an increased Near price? Or would that only benefit Aorora? Because Aorora uses eth right for the gas?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/237330)

2. **aurora network**

    @larry_lang --- *also joining Aurora channel and ask them directly could be a way to do https://t.me/auroraisnear* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/237691)

    @larry_lang --- *aurora doesnt charge u anything for gas  at the moment, maybe they will in the future, u should follow their channel to keep an update about it https://t.me/auroraisnear* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/237487)

    @TheGo1denBull --- *Good morning everyone. If you like storing your assets in your wallet NEAR has a unique web wallet that also has metamask capabilities when bridging to the Aurora EVM. You can create a reserved username wallet and fund it with ease. Also you can stake in available validator pools for a nice 11 percent apy. Here is a guide if you're interested.  https://medium.com/nearprotocol/a-starters-guide-to-the-near-wallet-and-staking-process-d2c8f3b61f43* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/236138)

    @angusmcmangus --- *Hmmm so the aim would be for aurora to not be successful in the long term as that would mean that people didn’t leave it to turn to near?  Also can you send funds directly to aurora direct from binance? As it seems from what I saw it needs to be bridged from near or eth first?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/237342)

    @angusmcmangus --- *haha very funny. get most blockchains you use the native token as gas. But I thoguht I had read that aurora uses eth not near. But obviously that was wrong* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/237499)

    @larry_lang --- *no project were born with the aim to be unsuccessful=)))* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/237352)

    @larry_lang --- *1. no 1 of the aim is to make attraction from EVM to RUST, as more evm DEVs try out the Aurora network, maybe they would also wanna learn RUST and build another native Near app, 2. oh about that the bsc is forked from eth if i remember correctly, so basically we just need a erc bridge from NEAR/aurora to BSC and we are good(under construction as we 're speaking btw)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/237350)

    @JUSTaDOLPHIN --- *Yea, more options would be nice as well, but just hiding the balance or showing NEAR as base unit is crucial I think* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/237927)
