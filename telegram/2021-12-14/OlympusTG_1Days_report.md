    @theMagicUnicorn --- *yes you are getting same amount of sohm under wrapper, so yes you can change to gohm, but as far as what the site will show, i am not sure, it may show something now, but it may update later bc it is in the middle of updating with v2 migration , so, but yes you will be fine, if you transform your sohm to gohm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/118057)

    @Paul --- *@ClearSight (or others :) ); the wrapped ohm (GOHM) will this be the staked version after the migration? Cause Im lost now. Have the GOHM and see them om my MM. But nothing on the olypusdao site. Not knowing if i get rewards or what this wrapped version is* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/117482)

    @Poopoo --- *Olympus but the website is being worked on at the moment for the migration, you can double check your balance by looking up your own address through the debank website or app* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/117968)
