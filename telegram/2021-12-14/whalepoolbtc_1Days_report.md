    @Bitcoinnect --- *Just follow the history. Chart is historical data. In 2014 bear market we bottomed at -86% So back in 2018, the most common calls were 2800 since that's -86% of 19800 We ended up bottoming at 31xx or something like that Basically a lot of frontrunning happened There was also a lot of talk about 200wMA providing support twice.  You're gonna need chart that goes back at least 4 years to get 200wMA (currently at 18.4k ish)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4080857)
