2. **pool**

    @tom0098 --- *If they're in an exchange, not really sure what your options are. I've found the best way to use BAL is to use it on the protocol, preferably on the polygon network because of the ultra low gas fees. Put the BAL in a liquidity pool with other assets youre bullish on, bonus points if its pays out APR rewards in BAL. then you can stake them back into the pool when you redeem them every week.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/13014)
