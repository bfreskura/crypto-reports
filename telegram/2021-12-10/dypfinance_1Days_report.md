    @Can --- *but already found a way, when i click all stats everything is listed 👌* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228071)

    @iamJubi --- *Yes and your current balance is what is shown as deposited LP and Deposited DYP on My Stats(view all) which you can also see the $ value as shown on the example shared. :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227878)

    @timdyp --- *My LP deposit = The number of LP that you got after 75% of your deposit has been added to liquidity into iDYP-WBNB My DYP deposit = The 25% amount that you got in DYP after your deposit If you click to MY STATS, you will see the approx. value of your LP and DYP into US $.   Also, on WITHDRAW you see the LP amount and the DYP amount. Why have we done this update? Before this update, we converted the LP value + DYP value and displayed one single value in US $. But because of the network sometimes the total value displayed the value without the DYP value and some users complained about this.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227799)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *You can go to MY STATS and see the approx. value of your LP in US $, and you can convert the total value in US $ into the numbers of LP. By doing this you will have the approx. value of one LP in US $.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228072)

    @Brian --- *Its poorly laid out. You have to add rhe 2 bold figures. The total roq is useless. And i have been reinvesting rewards so i bet they are included already in that total* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227894)

    @Brian --- *I just mean that if you look at deposited lp in the total row it does not equal the bold $figure above it but rather that bold figure plus the bold deposited dyp. That's a bad layout* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227897)

    @iamJubi --- *Honestly I am lost with what you meant but as we can see on the image, The figures are clear and the total is right.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227900)

    @Brian --- *Where as yours adds the 2 lines and gives a total in row 3* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227907)

6. **bold figure**

    @Brian --- *I only have 1 line of bold* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227903)

    @Brian --- *Looking closer it looks like if i add the bold deposited lp to the bold deposited dyp it equals the 1st non bold figure  in the total row so really i have lost 600 not gained 800* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227891)

Now it is already 10% drop in 15 minutes, what the heck is this No change in idyp price so drastic, avax is stable as well. There is no logical explanation for this* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227340)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Yes because your deposited value is 25% converted to DYP and also the LP value changes base don market prices of paired tokens* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228100)
