    @sertezx --- *Ktna mst etc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311078)

    @Teeyang99 --- *I bought KTNA. And then I was blacklisted. I am forced to not be able to sell KTNA.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311531)

    @Teeyang99 --- *I repeat is only 1 KTNA token. Before that I was still trading. And now. my friend still deals with it. I still trade it with another token. very normal operation.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311526)

    @Teeyang99 --- *I still cannot trade KTNA. And banned on the blacklist. You guys didn't respond and ignored my request for support. I waited for you for 3-4 days. About 96 Hours. And you don't want to support me. very sad and disappointing.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311527)

    @stanes --- *So obviously this Dextools doesn't find this pair. I am sending that to the devs, they will fix it asap. We are supposed to show all the pairs on Dfyn (Polygon side), if you find some other ones with an issue, please let us know. Thank you for reporting 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311335)

    @biggiesmalls5001 --- *This should show 800+ holders but dextools shows 478 does an admin here need to update it?   https://www.dextools.io/app/bsc/pair-explorer/0x5d9b8b85fc542c99be5894ffd4d7352b3ccec382* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/310563)

    @ruganalman --- *Thought so, since I could not find it. I assume it uses web3 to listen for created events from the swap addresses? Either way, how do you rationalize closed source software for an industry/comunity that encourages transparency and decentralization, and discourages obfuscation and moderation? I know it sounds like a rude question, but I am honestly just curious as I too try to develop web3 daps in a largely web2 world.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311486)
