1. **buy time**

    @mislavjavor --- *Since we’ve been having a lot of questions on the state of the project, here is a small update (after the FAQ):   * The Fundraising platform is still being actively upgraded with new features, but we consider it to be functionally complete. There will be a minor UX/UI overhaul and an addition of a so-called “Instant Invest” flow - where our service bots perform the invest transaction for people paying with credit cards and bank transfers. This will enable the “set and forget” invest modes * New clients, which were briefly mentioned on the screenshot - are being onboarded, with a couple of others coming soon. The investors will be notified when they launch - unlike pure DeFi protocols, for RWAs onboarding new assets usually takes a few months.  * PontoonDAO is currently at the most active stage of R&D. We’re looking to integrate with other tokenization platforms, equity crowdfunding platforms and similar to create “branded” indexes.  * Our team has expanded a bit and we’re activelly working on sales and development. We are re-evaluing the sales model as the last few clients were unsucessful in raising campaigns. We are trying to work with large companies to implement our tech in their stack, this will take quite some time, but it’s the best way to achieve long term profitability * The AMPnet company is fully funded and operational to survive a potential bear market * PontoonDAO might have a new token, this is still not 100% - if it does, AAPX holders will “farm” the new token, by staking AAPX for a period of a couple of months. This will be the only way to get the PontoonDAO token, except for farming it direclty by providing liqudity to PontoonDAO indexes (meaning - PontoonDAO will *not* have it’s own token sale) * We are in negotiations with a CEX for a possible listing, however - it might require a reevaluation of our buyback model for a staking/yield-farming model.  And to address a mentioned point - AMPnet has launched AAPX token in March because we had a deal prepared with Greenpeace and $40M of projects live on the platform. It was just as much a surprise to us that Greenpeace underperformed so spectacularily.   However, all future developements and even potential pivots will use AAPX as the base - so the holders will be rewarded, no matter how AMPnet starts making money.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35378)

    @IlDiavolo92 --- *We have time, buy at this cheap price and forget for few years.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35586)

    @runex_x1 --- *indeed, this was one of the ideas I had when they launched ampnet a long time ago. That the stakers would verify projects and these projects would be promoted with an ampnet-label. I still think this is the way forward as it creates a pool/community of projects. Now, the pontoondao may more or less do this with the baskets. The liquidity-pools/token per basket seems a good way forward and makes entry easier. However, I still think they should promote and create communities around individual projects. There is not so much value in paint, but what you do with the paint.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35439)

    @Domy177 --- *I haven't stopped by for some time and just now I'm seeing this Pontoon dao news. It looks like Pontoon dao will likely have it's own token and if that turns out to be the case, what will be utility of native ampnet token, what will be ones reason to buy native ampnet token?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35541)

    @Roelie --- *Congrats new atl🍾* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35563)

    @ivankardum --- *And as for marketing and promotion in general, it will be, but in a different way. Partnerships with large companies that integrate AMPnet technology will be promoted, and we aim to be those companies / organizations that already have projects and will have them, but also have investors, and our technology allows them to optimize the investment flow. This is something where we as AMPnet see a space for us, as a real whitelabel platform, especially when we add a new service - Pontoon DAO* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35447)
