    @ten10ten1011 --- *I was playing a bit with Aurora and was a bit confused with the RPC architecture. As I understand the Aurora architecture, the only way to submit the new blocks to the Aurora mainnet is by using the relay.aurora account. Will the Aurora be centralized around the main RPC that could only submit the new blocks?  Will it be possible to submit new @avshevchenko* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/230307)

    @avshevchenko --- *Yes, we expect the big wave of users and projects. In fact every week on Aurora we have at least 3 projects rolling out and the spiral only goes up.  The big amount of users result in higher load on the RPC servers, so we’re improving them as fast as possible. In fact we’re doing something that is yet unseen in the blockchain space. We’re changing the way how RPC works from the traditional approaches to the ‘message bus’, which is how Google is working at the moment. This stack of tech is one of the things that will enable Aurora to scale to billion users.  At the moment Aurora is capable of processing the amount of transactions close to what Ethereum is showing. In the short term we expect that the throughput will increase x10 due to various performance upgrades. Afterwards, the sharding of NEAR will come into play and enable the unprecidented scaling of EVM.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/230100)

    @avshevchenko --- *This is decided by the RPC. At the moment the rate is 0. So Aurora users are paying 0 gas fees for the transactions. Amazing, huh?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/230567)
