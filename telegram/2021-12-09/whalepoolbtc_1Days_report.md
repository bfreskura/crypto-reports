10. **btc problem**

    @pleb2king --- *Hey guys, I bought around 35 bitcoins a few years ago (2015) when it was around $280 USD each. I have never bought anything else, no icos, no shitcoins, just 1 purchase of 35 Bitcoins. I held through the 2017 bull run and 3 year bear market after that, nearly committed suicide for not selling. I don’t want to hold for another 3+ years bear market like the pleb I was not selling in 2017 and buying back cheaper. I am getting an itchy feeling that BTC is running out of steam, what do you guys think? Sell it all and wait for 2023 to buy back? Doing a 3x of 35 BTC to 105 BTC would be great for me if Bear market dumps 90% again.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4077308)
