2. **syndicate**

    @superpowerroy --- *SYN CITY is the first ever Mafia Metaverse! Players can grind in daily events, PvE, PvP, and Syndicate events such as cross-chain tournaments.  The Mafia will allow #Synners (players) grind their way up through daily missions, events, battles, and much more. Manage your own syndicate, assign tasks, and govern to collect taxes. Syndicates will be able to form powerful cartels to coordinate attacks and acquire resources as you take over real-world cities around the globe.   The Mafia is an ever-green theme and we wanted to take it to the next level* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/406088)

    @superpowerroy --- *SYN CITY is an action-adventure RPG game in which the players acquire, manage, trade, and expand members of their syndicate. Featuring a cutting-edge gaming engine, bridging the gap between real-world non-fungible token (NFT) utilities and decentralized finance (DeFi) functions.   Displaying a stylized take on the world of modern syndicates, SYN CITY takes this concept a step further by making the game free-to-play — play-to-earn, and truly making the Metaverse more accessible. SYN City is developed by our team of industry experts from Disney, Ubisoft, Roblox, EA, Gameloft, Google, Yahoo and Twitter* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/406086)
