    @babauziu --- *Heyy, I am new to atom and I'd like to ask about the staking:) Is there a minimal amount in order to be eligible for airdrops?   Also, someone said that not all validators make you eligible? Is that true?  Thanks!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/480828)

    @CristiTCM --- *hello. why Cosmos has no max supply? where can i understand this better?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/480272)

    @AtomJazz --- *So basically there's no one rule. Cosmos is an ecosystem of application specific blockchains so new Cosmos project like to airdrop a part of their supply to bootstrap community. Osmosis, Juno, Stars, Desmos, HUAHUA and many others all dropped to ATOM stakeholders.
