1. **decentralization, decentralised, network**

    @zet07 --- *Centralized takes power of the people, it is like a huge dictator that cou cannot and should not trust  Decentralized is like a open field of people who like the idea and join in, with the time, power comes trough the people to the people* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/917173)

    @bhnoww --- *I wouldn't be so sure - the market has proved ppl doesn't care about centralization* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/916601)

    @Sevith --- *I dont know everything, im saying most peoples understanding of 'decentralization' is a misunderstanding; You were referring to the coins themselvs, and supply as some means of decentralization which is incorrect? distribution!=decentralization.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/917197)

    @Sevith --- *Well, we can argue about the monetary properties of a network but there can still be decentralization without those other aspects, someone mentioned consensus which is more or less a by product of the decentralization itself. We don't NEED these things for a 'decentralized thing'  I just think a lot of peoples perspectives are skewed on what decentralization really is. like I said its just the network itself. You can have a very distributed network geographically, but said token might be controlled by like a small % of people running that network. (super majority etc etc) So decentralization has nothing to do with the monetary properties of a system, thats the DISTRIBUTION aspect of it. I just think some people are confused about it (as we were talking earlier)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/917281)

    @Sevith --- *He's specifically referring to the development of bitcoin.  I have already stated this several times;.....................  DECENTRALIZATION ONLY HAS TO DO WITH THE GEOPHRAPHICAL NETWORK DISTRIBUTION OF NODES IN A PARTICULAR SYSTEM; Nothing more; Nothing less.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/917170)

    @Sevith --- *(had a meeting)  In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network  (Hence the distributed network part)  Without a distributed network, there is no decentralization, it all lies in the network layer itself, and nothing else as i stated before several times.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/917279)
