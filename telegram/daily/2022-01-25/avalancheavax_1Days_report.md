    @FelixAdi --- *Hey guys, I have a problem. Anyway I was in the process of transferring my metamask to ledger nano s, and I'm about all done besides my AVAX. So I tested a small amount, it shows both in wallet and app and snowtrace, then I transferred my full amount. After that I find out somehow there's a bug with metamask and I can't access that avax, it's giving enable smart contract error (it's already enabled ofc),,, I contacted metamask support already and filed a ticket but not confident they will get back to me quickly. Is there any way I can access that AVAX? I tried different PC, different metamask, same bug.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324191)

    @Nicolas_A --- *There are several bridges that accept Weth from Avalanche. If the main one bridge.avax.network got hacked there might be some risk if the funds can't get recovered (exchange would confiscate the funds, stables would be frozen by Tether / Circle etc) The code is audited. All in all it's secure but yeah nothing in crypto has 0 risk* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324318)
