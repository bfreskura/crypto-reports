1. **stronghold, staking, iota**

    @PiernasLocas --- *There is a project called TanglePay for android. I saw it in the google playstore that it has the possibility to do the staking. I didnt try it because i prefer to wait for a recommendation from iota foundation.  Do you know if they approved that wallet?  Thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/307592)

    @⠠⠵ Lucas! --- *There were some red flags last time I checked it: no full source code release and no stronghold usage in published one. I would definitely not recommend tanglepay wallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/307597)

    @Amit --- *Can i stake ioda using my Android* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/307590)

    @⠠⠵ Lucas! --- *👍 Is the only way to guarantee the are no undisclosed backdoors in the application. Also, although it is "only" for convenience, the stronghold level is isolation has a clear objective: providing a higher security to critical data (like the seed) from compromised operating systems. And smartphones are very risky ones.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/307636)

    @gjarete --- *Thanks for the question. not providing stronghold file is only not providing an alternative way to "login".* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/307638)

    @gjarete --- *Hi! I'm Garrett from TanglePay. Thanks guys for commenting! I just want to point out that not implementing support of Stronghold file is not making the app less secure. It is only making it less convenient. And we will update it once the IF library support that. =)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/307629)
