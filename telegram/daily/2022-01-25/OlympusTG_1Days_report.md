    @Marco --- *And if APY is lower, less people will buy OHM* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/169232)

3. **stake, staking, year**

    @satoshi_whale --- *Great. So it is associated with the staking time which means it changes for each user based on when they staked. This should be a gold mine for the early investors. Ofc price plays a factor too* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167759)

    @SMNFT7 --- *Check the calculations, if you stake at let’s say 27 OHM at $60 ($1.600 initial investment)at a 0.22% APY each rebase for a whole year (365 days) you would still make around 18K by then if price doesn’t recover* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167358)

    @Host_Matt --- *enter app, connect metamask, under dashboard you'll see stake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/169590)

    @Host_Matt --- *500+ this year but maybe thats fud, Topy says Olympus $1000 soon* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167274)

    @vipdent --- *I don’t intend in investing anymore for now in Olympus   Let’s see how it goes* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/168929)

    @vipdent --- *I bought on Friday at $70  Totally newbie with Ohm and staking etc  ( I have some other cryptos but all in wallet ).   Very easy - once you have done it :-)  Transfer money to an exchange ( I use Binance but any big exchange will do).   Open a MetaMask account.  ( chrome extension or phone app).  Write down your 12 words.  ( do not share with anyone - ever).   In your exchange buy ETH with your currency.  Withdraw all the ETH to the address from MetaMask  ( the blue long address).   After 2-3 minutes the ETH appear in MetaMask.   Go to Olympus.finance  Click ( tap) enter app Then click wallet.  Then get on sushiswap or get on uniswap.  ( sushiswap didn’t work for me.  Transaction timed out 3 times.  So I used uniswap).   In uniswap, tap on connect wallet.   Go back to MetaMask.  It should ask you if you want to connect.  There is a small gas fee.  Click accept.  ( in my case nothing happened.  I had to close MetaMask.  Open it again - and then the window appeared)  Now uniswap ( or sushiswap) can see your wallet.  Select “from “ ETH.  It will show you your ETH balance.  Select “TO” ohm v2  Do not select MAX.  I did this mistake.  Leave £15 ( $20) for gas fees.  I had to transfer again.  I didn’t have enough for the bloody gas fees.   And convert to ohm v2.   Now import the token ohm.  Address of ohm can be found on their DOCs. Their website.   https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/contracts/tokens  You need ohm v2.  Somewhere in the middle.   Add this token in MetaMask.  Your balance will appear.  I also added sohm and gohm in MetaMask wallet.  All addresses from their website above.   Then go to Olympus.  Tap wallet.  Connect.  Go back to MetaMask to approve the connection.  ( in my case didn’t work again. Close MetaMask. Open it again.  The window appears.  Approve connection. )  Now you can stake.  Max.  I chose sOHM.   Again you need to approve it in MetaMask.  There are again gas fees :(  That’s it.   Good luck.   It took me 4-5 hours to do it.  I feel you.   If any issues, reply here.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/168905)
