1. **kucoin, tx, metamask**

    @nat_nat2525 --- *Ahhh. That’s the problem. Kucoin runs on the eth chain. You’ve probably lost it all in the transfer. Contact kucoin support. But I believe that is the problem.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/640823)

    @Hard Money --- *Need some help.  Bridged ETH USDT to Fantom and now hold fUSDT. Trying to buy FTM on Spooky. I use metamask with Ledger. Each time I try to approve the use of my fUSDT I go through the steps I'm told to through but never get the "review transaction" screen on ledger. I've done this hundreds of times on other chains. Anyone have any idea what's going on? Scammers, don't bother DM'ing, you'll be blocked.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/639899)
