1. **money, inflation, wud**

    @Macro5674 --- *So we can all agree it's better than fiat, which is debt-based pyramid scheme where only cronies gets to climb above ranks , inflating our money by printing more constantly where our savings always devalued so that we always remain under pressure and keep people working ! And the fun fact is most of that printed money goes to corporates in loans which they don't even pay back mostly !* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050049)

2. **ltc, btc, coin**

    @archus --- *LTC is still pow and the functions of Omnilite are kinda limited compared to real Smart contracts, so why should actually people make use of it when also payments web3 providers are implementing tokens, of various layer1 chains that are way superior to LTC to use in terms of speed, transaction fees, validation time and stability   What also does actually speak for LTC to be used as coin to purchase when its more likely to be a dropping stable coin rather than using upcoming DeFi stablecoins?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049741)

10. **accumulate, dips, wreck**

    @Congressional_Liason --- *Haha 😂 You are buying. Good luck scaring weak hands. You do you.   Everyone else, research, and let's think for ourselves.   Fake bearish charting and chronic fudders are here to wreck you while they accumulate the dips.  I enjoy a good dip. They will say it will go lower; then it will bounce. :D  Research the fundamentals, and upcoming events. The market will follow the improvements.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049388)

    @Congressional_Liason --- *Well maybe. People who do that chronically think their posts affect them while they accumulate. Otherwise, they would not be here.   They wreck new owners and weak hands, but they don't care as long as they get more. I buy more when such posts increase, and the news is good, like now. :)    Think for Yourself, new people; the negative posters are buying too, that's why they are here.  Think for yourselves and enjoy.   I love these dips being long. Omnilite, MWEB, Flare, Adoption, Collaboration; it's all coming to LTC this year and soon when least expected.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049383)

    @Congressional_Liason --- *Enjoy everyone. I accumulate the dips, and so do many bearish charters.   Research and think on your own, be cautious of letting them wreck you or create unnecessary fear while they accumulate despite what they say.  :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049384)

    @Congressional_Liason --- *Good people can be found. :) Enjoying the dips here. :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049380)

    @bake_Crypto --- *Maybe today makes second bottom for C. We will ser if it doesn’t dip to invalidation.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049817)

    @Congressional_Liason --- *Some information but mostly whales are trying to scare new holders and wreck weak hands to replace them with long-term holders, like themselves.  Enjoy. :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049875)
