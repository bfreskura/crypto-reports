6. **project, integration, announcement**

    @harrumphharrumph --- *"Partnership” is an overused word in crypto.  Current integrations are announced through Twitter and later listed on Chainlink Ecosystem.  The nature of the integration will be included in the official announcement you can find through the above links.  If an integration has not been announced there are two possibilities: * A project is using Chainlink on it’s own accord since Chainlink is an open source project that anyone can use. * An announcement is forthcoming acknowledging the integration.  Please be aware that an announcement of an integration is not an endorsement of another project and that you should perform due diligence.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366413)
