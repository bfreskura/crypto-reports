1. **dfi, defi, exchange**

    @ExPwr --- *Guys, what is currently the cheapest, most recommended route to bring more assets into cake.defi? Would like to stay away from ERC20.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166361)

    @zachgax --- *Those fees are negligible I feel in terms of swapping between different coins. Since there are many factors involved. The exchange you’re on, the fees they charge, and ultimate the price difference between the coin and dfi when you perform the swap.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166382)

    @UGilgamesh --- *Hi everyone! I'm wondering - having some tricky things to do to charge my Cryptopay card with some of my earned DFI (indeed, I have to swap DFI to dLTC in the light wallet, send dLTC to cake defi and then send LTC to my Cryptopay account and charge the card) - whether it is planned by Cake DeFi to provide some day a virtual card or something similar to pay directly from my Cake account.  Is that even a thing or I'm just dreaming about it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166349)

    @Ganative1978 --- *As far as impermanent loss, is it better to liquidity mine Defi against a stable coin such as tether, or better to stake it against something like litecoin? Or would something like Bitcoin versus Bitcoin cash be better??* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166759)
