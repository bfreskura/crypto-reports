    @Jacob_XRD --- *Thank you for the input.

    @BenzBoyJon --- *JAmes was heavily shilling saito not to long ago lol* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343308)

    @NotBen --- *Generally we would like to strongly discourage off-topic and potentially offensive discussion* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343577)

    @NotBen --- *They have no right to anything. It is a privilege to be here and if someone is behaving offensively, the team and the mods reserve the right to mute or ban them* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343580)

    @1000x --- *So mute them.  Why deprive them of read rights? It just looks like spite.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343579)

    @sebcrypto --- *Existing in a channel or group is not offensive* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343572)

    @NotBen --- *Think of it as a permanent mute without viewing privileges* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343566)

    @Alex --- *Guys without saying it is price talk. Are there any news I potentially missed, that the market reacts so strong in this direction?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/342771)

    @Wolf Speakers --- *That's the same day the price collapsed. Those bastards!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343386)

    @PR888DN --- *And no other major event coming up soon to boost the price?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/342873)

    @IskrenR --- *Does that realeas finally mean we can be listed somewhere, or are we still waiting for something additional?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343700)

9. **scrypto, great, won**

    @saeglopur10 --- *Also, what's this? Was looking up info on Scrypto and found something posted on Github by IOHK (Cardano)... https://github.com/input-output-hk/scrypto* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343383)

    @Jazzer9F --- *The third instalment in the blog series focusing on our new programming language, Scrypto, is now live on the blog!  https://www.radixdlt.com/post/scrypto-an-asset-oriented-smart-contract-language* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/342657)

    @Avaunt --- *#roundtable As we know Solidity is the basic root cause for a lot of hacks and exploits in De-Fi, however it also weirdly keeps a lot of people employed in security and auditing roles. People who get paid alot of money to pen test, white hat hackers, auditing firms etc. How does the team plan to counteract the argument or issue of loss of income from the people or organisations who will be impacted when Scrypto becomes mainstream. It will effectively make their role redundant or at a minimum reduces their income.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/342954)

    @tesslerc --- *Scrypto is so easy to learn that even my 2.5y old can learn to build dApps 😉* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343413)

    @Sciwalker --- *It's not purely coincidence, because scrypto is basically just a wordplay between "script" and "crypto". Anyone designing a toolkit that has these two main themes would have easily thought about this term.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343394)

    @thenotthatgreat --- *started with scrypto yesterday so i'm no expert* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/342943)

10. **api, date, exact**

    @Avaunt --- *Changing topic, I'm surprised no-one has asked Wen API lately...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343586)

    @sonotopia --- *no exact date is given yet and to be honest giving exact dates doesn't work for tech development* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/342871)

    @NotBen --- *Layer 1 requires actual engineering work to integrate* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343656)

    @sonotopia --- *api is production ready and released!!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343647)

    @Mleekko --- *not fully though, I'm still waiting for docs on running my own Gateway API cluster* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343613)

    @yr12345678 --- *Soon after the API update would be my guess, to leverage the new API* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/343052)
