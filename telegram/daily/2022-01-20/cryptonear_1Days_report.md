3. **stnear, staking, metapool**

    @iwllbel --- *there is something I don’t understand tho. So I staked my near in meta, then I used stnear in ref and staked it in a farm oin-stnear (so I swapped half my stnear to oin)  Do I still earn staking rewards in meta..?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/293728)

    @GeorgePro1 --- *This is the answer  When you swap stnears or transfer them into another account. your stake on meta disappears and no longer accumulating until you acquire them back.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/293740)

    @GeorgePro1 --- *The moment you swap near for stnear your staking in metapool stops(in simple terms)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/293742)

    @iwllbel --- *if I staked near into metapool, I rec stnear, then on ref finance, I swap that to wnear and unwrap to near… does that mean I can stake this same amount of near into metapool again and the process repeats?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/293660)

    @supersaiyan_goku --- *If I stake 100 Near to Metapool, I will get 100 stNear If I swap stNear to wNear atm I will receive 104 wNear, then I got 104 Near after unwraped? 🤔 Is there anything wrong here?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/293709)

    @Diederiek --- *Hey, hope you re OK. I have a question. I can accès my near wallet again since yesterday, but the balance still ain't ok. I mean 17 January I deposited NEAR from binance into my wallet, this I can see in recent activity, then I staked the amount with a validator (same day), but I cannot see these in staking panel. Instead when I go to near-staking.com I find them there (with my other delegated validators) with the rewards accumulated.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/291945)
