    @Janevietani --- *Helpful tip:   if you want a cheaper alternative than bridging ftm and paying eth gas From binance(US) ,crypto.com or kucoin, get BNB and withdraw as BNB BEP20, then use https://spookyswap.finance/bridge To bridge BNB BEP20 to BNB Fantom Then use spookyswap to swap BNB Fantom to FTM  You will need ftm gas for transaction. Use the faucet https://www.mentasuave01-tools.com/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/636922)

    @DrT0MO --- *I was told that fantom have a bridge by ferrum?  I spoke to ferrum and they said this:  We're already compatible with BSC, Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Moonriver, and Fantom  It consists of our entire product suite of 8 products! These include 5 different Staking as a Service solutions, a revolutionary open ended Reflection Staking protocol  So I'm wondering if anyone here from fantom has used it? So I can give feedback to my team, if we should us it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/635747)

2. **ftm, project, think**

    @perfumderose --- *I wanted to buy some FTM but I am confused by the 3 different tokens I have found.  Also I made two trial buys (small amounts) of FTM on Pancakeswap and poocoin I think and both transactions are visible on bscscan but the tokens have not appeared in my wallet.  And I did import them, the 3 FTM ticker symbols.  Why does it have to be so confusing and why don’t you explain how to buy some in your pinned message?  Also I tried Kukoin but I was unable to complete my registration there because of some circular computer reasoning- can’t explain.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/636129)
