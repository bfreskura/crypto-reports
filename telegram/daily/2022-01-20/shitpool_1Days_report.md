1. **btc, market, risk**

    @MoneroPal --- *The VC plays are where the real money is. If you look at the deals, it has all been into projects with fundamentals. As an example, DyDx, it is the second highest earning platform after OpenSea from fees. There is massive VC interest in DeFi 2.0 because of the fees (fundamentals). Ribbon, Vega, and all the other decentralized derivatives exchanges are doing very well. Lots of institional uptake on those platforms, major money, lots of fees…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/718063)

    @MoneroPal --- *It’s all fucking bullshit, the market is almost entirely lowly commoners high on hopium hoping to make it big like the early entrants into ETH and BTC. The reality is few of those are even wealthy, most sold out, or lost it all due to lack of knowledge, sophistication, and stupid trades.   All the money in the space is made via traditional VC’s, meaning those that only accept fiat, accredited investors, and are properly structured with feeder funds in the correct jursidictions. The quant and trade finance companies e.g., Alameda, QCP Capital, Kronos, and so on also crush.   The rest is just the same regurgitated noise over and over for the most part* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/718061)
