## 🔝 **Top keywords and related messages**

1. **dfi, exchange, btc**

    @zachgax --- *Those fees are negligible I feel in terms of swapping between different coins. Since there are many factors involved. The exchange you’re on, the fees they charge, and ultimate the price difference between the coin and dfi when you perform the swap.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166382)

    @UGilgamesh --- *Hi everyone! I'm wondering - having some tricky things to do to charge my Cryptopay card with some of my earned DFI (indeed, I have to swap DFI to dLTC in the light wallet, send dLTC to cake defi and then send LTC to my Cryptopay account and charge the card) - whether it is planned by Cake DeFi to provide some day a virtual card or something similar to pay directly from my Cake account.  Is that even a thing or I'm just dreaming about it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166349)

    @YSL --- *Is there a way to auto freeze the rewards from the freezer ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166384)

    @ExPwr --- *So LTC will be better than BTC in terms of the fees?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166376)

    @zachgax --- *You can auto-stake, but it doesn’t auto freeze. And I think that’s a better system. Because Freezing cannot be undone, so it’s better if you manually authorise it.   What I do is freeze in batches so that my freezer isn’t littered with very small amounts. So I let my rewards add up to a certain amount of DFI, then I freeze it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166392)

    @YSL --- *Just computed the compounding effect to auto freeze the rewards for another 10 years is huge .. I do hope cakedefi able to have this features to allow users to have option to auto freeze the rewards too .* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166390)
