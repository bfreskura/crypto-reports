1. **price, launched, smr**

    @Lyfee --- *But the price per token has nothing to do with how similar projects are. It's almost completely depending on the supply of tokens.   Look at this: Someone staking 100 MIOTA for the full 90 days will earn around 75 Million SMR.   If Shimmer started trading for $2 it would turn thousands of people into multi-billionaires and thats not how money/ crypto works. You are more likely to look at something like $0.0000001 per SMR.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/307106)
