2. **yoroi, restore, issues**

    @glitch04 --- *Check the wallet using a third party explorer like Cardanoscan.io that will tell you where the wallet is delegated Yoroi is having syncing issues and has not been accurate you may need to try another wallet alternative like ccvault.io adalite.io or tyhponwallet.io* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771134)

3. **cardano, dex, dapps**

    @ExInfernis --- *Does anyone know why most of the dapps on cardano are not supporting official wallets like yoroi/daedalus? For example sundae swap is supporting nami and ccvault. I dont see any good reason for this is as a lot of people are using the official wallets for safety.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/770948)

    @colombos1991 --- *I think is more trusted to use cardano wallet that was made by cardano and not other company..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771283)

4. **hardware, device, wallet hardware**

    @glitch04 --- *You would need to create a wallet with the device and transfer everything over to that new hardware secured wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771819)

    @glitch04 --- *they use less resources but the risk is you losing a little bit of the security unless you have the wallet hardware secured* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771269)

    @colombos1991 --- *So you can say that to use hardware wallet with Adalite os better than to use deadalus without hardware wallet?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771277)

    @glitch04 --- *Depends on if you have resources to run the full wallet or not* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771253)

7. **epoch, stake, pool**

    @apex_pool_spo --- *when you delegate to another stake pool, the current epoch and the next epoch you still delegate to the old stake pool, the epoch after that you delegate to the new stake pool.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771554)

    @glitch04 --- *you have until the 25th so no if you move before the epoch, any further help you will need to ask in their support channel* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771809)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *you won't need, nothing will happen in 5 epochs (25 days).* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771766)
