    @ismailluk03 --- *Crypto about to get us to the next level* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/25354)

    @jasondi --- *There are tons of strategies out there and like everything else, some are good, some are bad. On rare occasions even good ones can fail you and and bad ones will make you. There is no one size fit all for the markets, crypto or stocks or anything else.  However, safest bet is to look at it from a certain perspective which is: Try not to lose the money you have made and don't stress over losing money you didn't make in the first place. Once you make your peace with that thought process, set yourself a benchmark of 10% or 20% or whatever percentage gain for selling and sell once you hit that and don't stress if it keeps running. Wait for it to cool back down, find its bottom and buy in again to repeat the process.  Compound your gains. If you started with $100, first run you will come out with $110. Next round, you will be aiming for 10% of $110.   Just like the first thing I said, even this is not a guaranteed green strategy. It will fail you at times so have a benchmark for cutting your losses as well.   TL;DR: Have a plan. Follow it. Don't look back.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/25338)
