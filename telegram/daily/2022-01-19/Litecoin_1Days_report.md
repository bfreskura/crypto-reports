6. **accumulate, dips, posts**

    @Congressional_Liason --- *Haha 😂 You are buying. Good luck scaring weak hands. You do you.   Everyone else, research, and let's think for ourselves.   Fake bearish charting and chronic fudders are here to wreck you while they accumulate the dips.  I enjoy a good dip. They will say it will go lower; then it will bounce. :D  Research the fundamentals, and upcoming events. The market will follow the improvements.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049388)

    @LemuelE03 --- *Bear market not yet confirmed tho, right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049113)

    @finitemaz --- *It's just degenerates who convinced themselves they move markets in this chat.  I can already tell you know more than most people engaging in price movements here.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049406)

    @Congressional_Liason --- *Well maybe. People who do that chronically think their posts affect them while they accumulate. Otherwise, they would not be here.   They wreck new owners and weak hands, but they don't care as long as they get more. I buy more when such posts increase, and the news is good, like now. :)    Think for Yourself, new people; the negative posters are buying too, that's why they are here.  Think for yourselves and enjoy.   I love these dips being long. Omnilite, MWEB, Flare, Adoption, Collaboration; it's all coming to LTC this year and soon when least expected.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049383)

    @bake_Crypto --- *Because, omg the big interest increase* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049325)

    @ck42069 --- *Not just because of the macro reasons but because of the massive 3.5 billion USD liquidation drawdown that happened in november december and january* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2048827)

    @Notbiden --- *Financial year ends are not even here yet that doesn't happen to march* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049342)
