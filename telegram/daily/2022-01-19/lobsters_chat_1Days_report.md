2. **funds, devs, access**

    @svenblockchain --- *Actually reading (attempting to understand the legaleze - https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2022/2.html) it seems he is claiming that nChain (BSV devs) are finishing up a tool to regain access to lost private keys. He is trying to attempt to force 15 other chain devs/companies to implement this or some similar feature in their chains so he can access 'his' funds again. But I could be reading it wrong.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/316717)

    @svenblockchain --- *This is such a confusing article. He is suing SV Devs? But if you read the article it seems as though he is suing 15 defendents, including most Bitcoin forks, to rewrite the protocol in suh a way that he can regain access to his lost(stolen) keys? What? He lost them post-fork?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/316714)

    @ivangbi --- *Treasury here is in real assets and it’s almost 1:1 so it’s fine. The question is whether they will keep sticking to their bond narrative or pivot. @fiskantes seems to be still behind the bond model and “original vision” while Dani turned south and is now admitting to having done continuous ICO, ready to turn it into a VC fund* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/316406)
