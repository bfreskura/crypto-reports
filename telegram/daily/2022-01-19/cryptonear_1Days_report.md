    @beep42 --- *Rainbow doesn’t even work. The whole issue is with this “single use funding address.” That is complicating this whole user flow so much because it doesn’t recognize as a valid address like anywhere. Fucking horrible design. I’m a developer that has an app built on testnet and I can’t even deploy. Fucking joke protocol. Maybe I’ll try again when the tech is more mature.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/290610)
