2. **staking, stake, validator**

    @Matt_Blocks_United --- *Staking is one of your best options. Current APY on our node is over 14%. You can stake in Guarda, Rainbow, Trust wallet, Ledger Live, Keplr and Cosmostation. But Keplr is the preferred wallet.   We have a staking tutorial that shows both Keplr and Cosmostation in action with a connected Ledger. You can check it out here https://blocksunited.com/how-to-stake-cosmos-atom-tokens/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/477605)

    @AtomJazz --- *Staking is really simple. You need Keplr or Cosmostation wallet, you then need to select a validator (ideally someone with commission lower then 10% and not an exchange validator like Binance Coinbase or Kraken)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/476610)

    @lindsey_with_an_e --- *oh gotcha thanks! but how do I properly report this? its DANGEROUS in how many fake posts theyve amassed that seem true with people receiving SO MUCH and also then taking advantage of the ACTUALLY amazing cosmos ecosystem and and how they do reward people involved more so than anyone ive seen in so many ways and playing off that...  only option for reporting seems to be spam that really doesnt fit exactly the issue?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/476847)
