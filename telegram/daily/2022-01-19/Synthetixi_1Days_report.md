    @Crypto --- *Thank you Chi Liun, and thank you for the /up vote! I appreciate those a lot. Synthetix is one of my greatest passions and I'm honored to help educate fellow community members!  And whoever else replied to my comment with /up I appreciate it.  I've been saying for a long time, top 30 is within reach very soon, maybe even top 10 in next 12 months.  Some may say this is conservative, some may say not aggresive enough target. Will not please everyone, but this is just my thought process.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18726)

6. **binance, staking, believe**

    @Crypto --- *Launchpad, trading contests, tons of community campaigns like AMAs, defended Synthetix about the recent crash, and at every step of the way has shown they support Synthetix strongly. They will DEFINITELY host staking for Synthetix. I am 99% sure of this.   I hope these insights help everyone to understand why I, and my company LDA strongly back and believe in Matic as the main marketshare holder for Ethereum which I believe will beat out all of the other platforms for dapps, games, DeFi, and other blockchain protocols.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18724)
