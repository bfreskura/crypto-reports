2. **project, follow, users**

    @The_Stache --- *I like that you guys are building a solid foundation before the influx of traffic. This is the right way. Do you expect and increase of launches on your Launchpad?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365978)

    @twinturbo_dev --- *how long before the iOS / android application* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365961)

    @ivansnowmobile --- *Currently, we do not have any plans regarding it - only slight renewals of our frontpage, but if some big updates will come, our team might think of it. Besides, we are constantly gathering feedback from our community, so if it will feel that current logo does not represent the project's values, we will also consider the change.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365864)

    @RomainSwitzerland --- *No 😌 As a rule the team doesn’t offer timelines for development targets. You can follow development progress via github* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366382)

3. **transient, industry, dapp**

    @Lonzocrypto --- *What makes our project special is that we are looking to provide a decentralised platform that is simple enough to provide a newest entrant in the space the services to onboard and manage their portfolio from A to Z, while remaining sophisticated to satisfy the demands of more seasoned users.   We believe that this is one of the keys to fostering mass adoption in the space.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365933)

    @zero4356 --- *Is there a plan to allow using credit/ debit cards to buy crypto or will it stay as decentralised as possible? If so, would this be rolled out in the app?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365958)

    @Blockbaas --- *I have a question for the developers... Which Programming Language is the best to develope with Blockchain (of course solidity) and? Python or Js(react) ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366048)

4. **tokens, token, holders**

    @Lonzocrypto --- *Sphynx is an all in one decentralised exchange. We go beyond just being a standalone swap.  We have launched on two chains, BSC and ETH with the following features:   - Charts   - Swap (Pancake, Uniswap and Sphynx) tokens   - Limit orders (ready to go live)   - Stop Loss (going live this week)   - Launchpad (BSC and ETH)   - Farming   - Staking   - Bridge (pending for prices to match, but ready to go)   - Lottery   - NFTs (Whitelist to Presales and Fees of the bridge)  Our ecosystem is all in one, all our utilities work indirectly back to the sphynx token.   Our vision is to make our holders feel like shareholders rather than just token holders. With that we redistribute 50% of the whole ecosystem fees back to the holders on a weekly basis.   This does not mean we have to sell tokens or hurt the chart as these fees come in BNB or ETH. And they go back to the holders of Sphynx token.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365929)

    @copynat --- *Yeah we don’t know how to price this so went with just 1 link. To busy developing 😂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366464)

    @Zach1229 --- *So on Sphynx I will be able to use stop loss trading my favorite meme coins?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365963)

    @copynat --- *There is no inflation if you measure everything in LINK :D* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366474)

    @nam_nguyenson --- *Chainlink’s token total supply is 1 billion* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366258)

5. **question, questions, question let**

    @Marino_locos --- *So do we just ask questions?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365914)

    @PolivodaTatiana --- *I'm sure our readers have the same question* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366085)

    @marcromeron --- *I know that you could not tell me nothing about that. So I think the best way to know is asking my last question....* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365949)

    @marcromeron --- *Here we go with a very interesting question...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365853)

    @marcromeron --- *Let's go to the second question...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365831)

    @marcromeron --- *Let's jump to our first question...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365822)

6. **stop, keepers, limit orders**

    @Lonzocrypto --- *With the help of Chainlink we have been able to add extra features to our platform and change the way people tend to trade by implementing stop loss and limit orders through the chainlink keepers. This is the start for us using keepers as we plan to implement in many more places on our platform.  We have implemented VRF to the lottery contract to make it a more verified random generation of the numbers so players feel more confident with our platform and the fact it’s a way being more certified of being decentralised.   We also implement price feeds which allows us to receive accurate, real-time token pricing data.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365937)

    @joebogan --- *So basically it’s like pinksale, pancakeswap and a launchpad all rolled into one? Plus the Dex will have tools that you would normally only get on a CEX (such as stop loss and limit orders)?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365968)

    @Anderstalige --- *Looking forward to the developing partnership with gaugecash!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366438)

    @ivansnowmobile --- *Chainlink has been our trusted partner from the very start of our project. Our main partnership directions are: using their price feeds and their oracle technology for defining the final prices of each pool. Recently we have integrated Chainlink Keepers for automatic commission claims, so we can say for sure that top tech solutions presented by the Chainlink team have been a great help for Prosper’s development. We hope that we will extend this partnership and make our project better together.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365842)

    @joebogan --- *How does that work? Will that all be managed through the app?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365996)

    @QuantumLeap68 --- *whole lotta partnerships and price in cellar…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366462)

7. **staking, explicit staking, explicit**

    @nam_nguyenson --- *Explicit Staking is still being developed and planned for release in 2022. Be on the lookout for that.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366263)

    @Ale --- *Where will the staking rewards come from?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365623)

    @marcromeron --- *Take in consideration that once staking is live the LINK token, will be used as collateral by node operators to take on high value jobs.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365628)

    @Agustín --- *Hello! I have a question if someone can answer, where is the best place to do staking with this token (Link)?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/366375)

    @marcromeron --- *Staking is not yet live. This article provides an overview of explicit staking from the Chainlink 2.0 Whitepaper. This presentation by Sergey discusses staking and the difference between implicit and explicit staking, while in this other presentation Sergey announced the team is planning to implement some form of staking in 2022.  As a rule the team doesn’t offer specific timelines for development targets.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365614)

    @Zilllli --- *Any info on rewards for staking LINK?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/365741)
