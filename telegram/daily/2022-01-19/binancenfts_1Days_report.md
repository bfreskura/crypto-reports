10. **game, games, inspired**

    @arianagrinder89 --- *As we can see, many games on the market have a rather limited storyline. Do you believe your universe has enough depth? Is your story going to entertain us in addition to making money?#Dragonary* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/436332)

    @YilanGulsum --- *Were there any movies, books, games, etc., that inspired you when dealing with the story of your game? #Dragonary* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/436316)

    @Unlucky0014 --- *Are there any movies, books, games, etc., that have inspired you for your game's story?#Dragonary* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/436296)

    @Kenikky --- *I'm a bit of a sucker when it comes to game Lore and storytelling.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/436252)

    @Kenikky --- *Think a lot of Binancians here have very similar stories especially playing their NES or SEGA on a Saturday morning haha 😄* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/436245)

    @acoinary --- *Well, I was inspired to develop a game because I've been a gamer since I was born. This is not the first game I have developed. A few years ago, I created a mobile game that was my first experience in this field. I can indeed say that developing a game like Dragonary is really hard, demands a lot of work, and requires a large team to do it. Since I've been a gamer my whole life, I find that not owning the items I was paying for in a game is wrong. Therefore, I encourage the Play-to-own what you pay for.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/436244)
