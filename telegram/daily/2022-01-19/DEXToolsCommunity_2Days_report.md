1. **dextools, dext, support**

    @Natalia_Ave --- *To be honest DEXtools was one of things for my personal inspiration, especially your UI. There so many sources of info, things in one place and they don't seem like mess, but matches perfectly!   Future of DeFi is very hard to predict, but I believe that step by step DeFi will enter our daily routine in different ways!  done* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/326110)

    @Natalia_Ave --- *Cheesus provides pure data and objective metrics to give you onchain truth, but we don't give you any financial advices or fully ensure security of any project  So metrics for every project includes: - project profit and loss  - different types of holders e.g. traders, who bring life by selling and buying tokens, holders, who just hold tokens, do nothing with them, freeloaders who receive tokens by airdrop or any free distribution. Moreover we can track bots and fake wallets who pump prices and increase trading volume.  These data show how active the project are and you can conclude whether the project is worth investing in.  done* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/326087)
