    @panos_dim --- *So AMPnet is focused purely in Croatia market?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36550)

    @mislavjavor --- *If you culd clarify what you mean by sharing revenue I could elaborate. AMPnet charges a fee to all its clients, that is our revenue model, the fee is used to buyback aapx tokens and put them to the treasury* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36380)

    @North --- *Thanks. Do you think there may be potential for AmpNet to do on an international stage what Chiliz is doing with professional football teams? Chiliz work with a lot of big clubs like Juventus, Atheltico Madrid etc. Their platform and token really took off from this* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36391)

    @tradingjo98 --- *partnership with a national football team, oh god this must be kinda bullish* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36338)

    @mislavjavor --- *As always, there will be buybacks - the revenue for those, however, will not be coming only from the successfull collection of funds to the campaign, but also continuously - since AMPnet has several other fees included in the loyalty token business model. As for visibility - AMPnet has been assigned as the main sponsor for the HNS-CFF season and will be featured prominently on all football federation materials.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36371)

3. **sale, pre sale, pre**

    @PFCBLic --- *Cool. Thanks for answer! So setup fee will be generating buybacks? Will this be visible as  public event?  I think validating that buyback actualy works is very important for future of this token  I understand that price cant be fixation for the team but some focus is to be expected since this community also supported this financial stabilty team has in upcomming period* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36622)

4. **aapx, business, smart**

    @North --- *I really hope so. There are no details on how it benefits AAPX holders yet though which is unfortunate, but at least we have a great partner and some exposure now* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36339)

    @scemodonore --- *guess aapx will benefit from buybacks but let's wait for the ama later* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36341)

    @matejmz --- *What utility role will $AAPX have in this partnership?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36370)

5. **polygon, recommend, cex**

    @adhamalkhaja --- *I think polymath does something similar* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36545)

    @mislavjavor --- *Agreed, for low fees at this time, though - I can recommend the Polygon network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36387)

    @<UNK> --- *You kinda answered to this already, but I'd like to recommend atleast some CEX since ETH is congested all the time. I understand that something like Kucoin is now "pointless" until there is enough progression from this "new start", but there is some smaller CEXes like MEXC or AscendEX where you can get listed quite easily and can have decent userbase & volume* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36383)

    @panos_dim --- *Cool, lowcap, do you guys have any competitors in other chains?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36544)

    @<UNK> --- *Yea Polygon is fine, but TBH I never found it more convinient to use than some cex where I can quickly to trade different pairs and withdraw the coins I like. But maybe I should learn it better:)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36398)

    @matejmz --- *Just wondering - wouldnt it be better for them to deploy on Polygon?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36366)
