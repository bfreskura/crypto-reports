    @Cody_0x --- *Hey team. What is the rules re speaking about up and coming projects to avalanche?  I am invested in a project which is migrating to avalanche this month.   It is a diamond, trust worthy project with a great use case in my opinion.    Also, I am not affiliated with the project other than invested and support the team, I am curious what are the requirements if the team wants to do an ama on avalanche?

    @86u_yhLx30 --- *https://nitter.net/pic/media%2FE1l8L2dXMAExklv.jpg%3Fname%3Dorig  Not sure if what you says makes much sense. 42% initially belonged to VCs and insiders. 19% was allocated to foundations.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/323031)

    @ManyWizzard --- *Wsup guys. Look at the article which I've found. It seems like btc and eth maxis desperately trying to keep their chains alive. What do you think about it? https://yanmaani.github.io/proof-of-stake-is-a-scam-and-the-people-promoting-it-are-scammers/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/323177)

    @86u_yhLx30 --- *I'm not saying EOS is fundamentally better overall. Just saying its allocations are considerably less shady.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/323032)

    @Nicolas_A --- *60% of initial tokens are for public and the ecosystem. The public was able to purchase at the same price / terms as any VC. Except ETH all the tokens you mentioned are excuse me quite underwhelming. Really cute to make a 4 billion public raise (wow big public allocation 👏👏👏) like EOS and deliver nothing* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/323030)
