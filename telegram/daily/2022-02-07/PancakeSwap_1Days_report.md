    @HAITIENLK --- *👉Try trustwallet or safepal is work on 100%👈  ✅ Metamask - PC ✅ Safepal - iphone, android ✅ Trustwallet - android  Don't use metamask with phone ❌ Don't use Binance wallet with pc ❌ ---------------------------------------------------  You can import your wallet to any other wallets that works with Pancakeswap if you want. You can continue to use same wallet with your seed. That seed is not special for safepal or trust wallet or metamask. You can use it in any wallet app  You will write the seed words to new app with choosing "I have already a wallet" or " Import Wallet"  Trust ➜  Safepal Guide👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻 https://youtu.be/FSGmEW9fFA0* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2324782)

Can you please let me know the expected least APR in future?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2323422)
