1. **dextools, token, dext**

    @Edmund --- *Hi my token is listed on CMC, but the info on dextool is still zero, How do i validate my token* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/332315)

    @MademoiselleDL --- *Yes, but is there a limit to it on Dextools ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/331162)

    @Mark_Fowler --- *Hi ... I just recently added my token to Dextools ... Where it shows contract details it says that the token is not verified, I dont understand this as it is verified on bscscan ... please help* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/332207)

    @stanes --- *It's not how it works: We index all the pairs present on the DEXs we support. Once again: there is no listing process. We give some tools to users to downvote a pair if they think it's a scam. When you are interacting with some DEXs, you have to be extremely careful, most of the coins are scams or will anyway be valueless in the future.  Always DYOR, apeing any token without knowing anything about it is throwing your money away.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/331144)
