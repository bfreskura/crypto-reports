1. **case, lawsuit, ripple**

    @NialPial --- *The documents regarding Garlinghouse’s emails, are published, and the public hearing is 9 February. Thats why its going wild now.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3050041)

    @Sandy --- *“The reason why I still hold such a massive amount of XRP despite the sluggish price action is that I now kind of see it as a hedge against the rest of the market. If this SEC lawsuit ends – and I think it will, I don’t know when – but I think it will end ultimately favorably for Ripple and XRP and when it does end, XRP will essentially be the only crypto asset with regulatory clarity in the United States…  When the case does get settled, you can expect XRP’s price to absolutely pop. So if you’re waiting to hear the outcome of the case to jump in, you’re going to be too late. So you’re placing your bets right now and if your bet pays off and XRP wins, XRP is going to rocket, and then everything else is at the mercy of the SEC, and we don’t know what’s going to happen.”* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3050234)

    @XRPMUSTMOON --- *Maybe prepare due to the victory of the lawsuit immenent* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3049975)

    @acegeorge --- *well im sure 1 year now they had a lots of chances to get in and for the lawsuit to come to a settlement...but nothing about it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3050266)

    @ReiTeh --- *Well because when the lawsuit was announced, xrp was top 3. They can't sue btc and eth because they are in on it with the SEC. So they go after the next best thing. Well it's a long and complicated story. Ppl also do speculate that the lawsuit is a way to hinder XRP growth so that the rich can get in on it first and leave nothing to the general public.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3050265)

    @Voltaire123 --- *Is 10$ uberhaupt possible? I think end of Feb 2022 is to early but who knows. First lawsuit needs to be closed.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3049866)

    @XcHiLLz616 --- *Any thinking this months spiking in the market a pump n dump by whales especially knowing new investors are participating?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3049693)

    @ReiTeh --- *Remember to have money on the side Incase it dips! If I was a whale, when everyone is bullish, I would sell and short the market. That way I can buy at a lower price.   I personally nvr likes when it pumps. I thrive when it's low so I can bag more. If it goes up I wouldn't buy it and I just have to sit on my hands.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3050274)

    @brownpilled --- *I guess with XRP at $1000, mcap doesn’t really matter* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3049629)

9. **payments, banks, bridge**

    @ObiT3r --- *And buying xrp is not the same as an investment in the co, cos xrp affords u no rights in the co conventionally associated with share ownership. Not even close to rights as a debenture holder of a company.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3050222)

    @santa_domenica --- *Can I send messages within a xrp transaction?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3049583)

    @Cointh88 --- *Why Ripple’s XRP price hasn’t detached from Bitcoin yet? – JP Morgan report answers  “From what we can tell, Ripple has been working with banks to help them build infrastructure to make cross-border payments but few are using Ripple’s actual cryptocurrency to execute them”.  https://financefeeds.com/ripples-xrp-price-hasnt-detached-bitcoin-yet-jp-morgan-report-answers/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3050078)

    @ObiT3r --- *And if there is regulatory clarity on xrp, it doesnt mean that the other cryptos will be left naked. Simply because the decision in xrp would have established parameters as to what constituttes security which can be applied vis a vis other coins. Again my two cents worth* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3050247)

    @ObiT3r --- *I think xrp is better seen as a product which the company sells to do what the co has set out to do... Facilitate money trannsfers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3050229)

    @ZLee337 --- *We are little guys.  Imagine banks dropping millions into xrp to move payments.  This has yet to happen yet but it will very soon.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3049949)
