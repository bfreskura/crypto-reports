    @roshlink --- *From what I understand, and I may not be 100%. So if someone else can add that would be great.  CCIP will be a service of Chainlink, and similar to VRF, Keepers, PoR etc, will therefore would require x amount of LINK as a “gas fee”. I’m sure, with staking, there will be some collateral required too, but not sure about this. CCIP sounds like a wrapped token on other chains? And so the regularity of the “gas fee” could be every block, or whatever is set by the protocol developers.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/371879)
