1. **blockchain, oracles, chainlink community**

    @marcromeron --- *Chainlink was created in 2017 by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis (2 genius), who co-authored a whitepaper introducing the Chainlink protocol.  The same year they network with Ari Juels (Cornell University professor).  Their vision was that Chainlink acts as a "bridge" between a blockchain and off-chain environaments, to solve the oracle problem.  The network is used by smart contracts and was formally launched in 2019 on Ethereum mainnet.  Chainlink published a second white paper in April 2021. That paper, Chainlink 2.0: Next Steps in the Evolution of Decentralized Oracle Networks.  There is detailed a vision for expanding the role and capabilities of decentralized oracle networks to include hybrid smart contracts, which utilize on-chain code and off-chain services provided by oracle networks.  https://chain.link/whitepaper* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/368330)

    @CryptologistFox --- *Hi guys I have some question about Oracle that I couldnt find the answer yet. I would appreciate if you could help me with this.  1. I was wondering when and who first created the oracles?   2. Is Oracle machine theory the base of the oracle network?  3. Is the Chainlink first who lunched oracle in blockchain and decentrilized it.  Thank you in advance for your help* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/368328)
