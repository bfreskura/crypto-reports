    @bike4peace --- *If you would love OHM you would provide content that backs up your arguments   What you do is a mix of salty posting and saying ohm is not perfect while bringing ZERO solutions or anything that contributes to a community in terms of knowledge* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167291)

    @nfwaple --- *then just swap gOHM directly, or if you want to compare the price of swapping OHM, you can also check the dex price, if you want to swap OHM instead, just unstake your gOHM to OHM* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167036)

    @Ahmad --- *I agree with you. People love high APY and when Ohm APY decrease they jump ship and when to other protocols with high APY. I don't blame them, it is just business for them. For me, I believe Ohm will do well as their plans for 2022 look good.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167144)

5. **olympus, , partnerships**

    @nfwaple --- *IMO there should be a premium as Olympus as a protocol can generate revenue* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/166481)

    @nfwaple --- *ideally we need people that are aligned with Olympus' vision but it is not always possible, therefore it should never have been a pump and dump kind of token, recently a lot of people are suggesting locked staking to rewards holders, but I am not too sure if it would work out, since Olympus is really the first one in defi doing what it is doing* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/166500)

    @bestbotsro --- *so, let me tell you what I understand:    I have this sOHM, and when I go to olympus, it says that I need to migrate to v2.  I dont see anymore the value to raise, so the stake I think dont work, unless I migrate to v2.    v2 is still on ETH ? or can it be on AVAX too ?    I ask because of the big fees, and to see if worth to migrate.    thank you* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/165968)

6. **rebase, rebases, index**

    @vladdevelop --- *where they are falling every rebase* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167522)

    @Kbuxton90 --- *Was thinking of higher rebases. How wrong I was.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167046)

    @satoshi_whale --- *If it only still stays in positive rebase** **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167777)

    @nfwaple --- *negative rebase is like negative interest, it exists but it would almost never happen* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167780)

    @D7 ⭐️ --- *So what is the rebases i will get ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/165948)

    @cdp279 --- *Ser. Rebases are the yield you get based on the apy, a rebase is given every 8 hours.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/165960)

8. **gohm, stake, staked**

    @cdp279 --- *Ser. You don’t need to stake gohm. It is wrapped version of sohm.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/166004)

    @nfwaple --- *gOHM is already staked, no need to do anything* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167817)

    @nfwaple --- *yes, you can go to the stake page and see your gOHM staked there afterward, you can also get gOHM from another chain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167819)
