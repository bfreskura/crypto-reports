2. **market, bear, buy**

    @Tiny_Philosopher_784 --- *"Consistent downtrend" (you mean the price is going down, so take that to the price chat)  Also, you think a certain period of time, during which the US and world market pressures have been very hawkish with an unprecedented pandemic raging, means a bear market?   My goodness... the level of education needed to explain this would cost about $650k and 4 years of your life at Harvard or Yale.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/334758)

    @LoLo3PK2 --- *Thanks Mack! A few questions I have: 1. Where to see projects already running on Algorand? Mainly focusing on DeFi. 2. Where can I find official wallets for Algo? I use Brave, so if there is any browser extension for Brave, even better. 3. I assume ALGO network is not EVM compatible, so is there any L2 already launched for metamask? Any plans about it?  Thanks in advance!!!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/334724)
