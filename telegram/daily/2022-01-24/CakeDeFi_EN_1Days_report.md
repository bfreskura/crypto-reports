    @soulsensei --- *Can I buy DFI on the Cake DeFi platform* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167386)

    @Kenneth --- *Isn't buying BTC to convert to DFI not worth it given the expensive fees in BTC purchase?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167726)

    @John --- *Yes Jess I transferred DFI from cake to desktop DEFI walled, well received the amount then transferred to dBTC and now want to send the dBTC to cake for Lending. I have 22 DFI in UTXO not sure what I am missing here 😬* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167415)

    @gpkiefer --- *Question: if I wished to utilize the LM on the Defi desktop wallet for say, LTC-DFI pair, do I transfer my LTC from say Ledger wallet first to Cake to be wrapped/converted to dLTC and afterwards, transfer back to the Defi wallet in order to initiate the LM for the LTC-DFI pair?  Also if I wanted to convert back to LTC do I then transfer the dLTC back to Cake so I can withdraw LTC back to Ledger once I am done with LM?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167281)

5. **50, 30, bonus**

    @zachgax --- *If I may add on. Cake is not a spot trading platform. It’s an investment platform with long term goals for staking and liquidity mining. So don’t think of it as a run-and-gun scenario where you put in the minimum of $50 to get the $30 bonus and try to cash out immediately. Your $30 bonus is frozen for 6-months anyway.  You could put in a comfortable buffer of about $100, freeze along with the $30 for the same 6 month period. Use the time to learn more about Cake and Defichain, see how your rewards accumulate. I can guarantee that within this 6 month lock-in period, you’d be confident enough with the project to invest more.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167722)

    @Kassius84 --- *If you register yourself at Cake DeFi and you deposit at least crypto worth $50, you will receive a sign up bonus in DFI worth $30.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167566)

    @DmgBautista --- *Hi! Yes if the deposit is the first and at least 50$usd or more at arrival to Cake. The 30$usd tokens will be frozen for 180 days earning interest, but the initial deposit can be withdrawn if not invested into any other service* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167472)

    @YSL --- *💯 I’m 100% on staking with cakedefi as I believe on capital appreciation (DFI) and lazy to monitor LM hence staking is best for me . Just let it stake and compounding effect take place* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167368)

    @Kassius84 --- *Sorry I got you wrong, if you register at Cake DeFi and deposit cryptos worth $50, your $30 sign up bonus is locked for 180 days* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167568)

    @zachgax --- *That’s good, quite a few replies to why they couldn’t withdraw their $30 immediately. Anyway, just use any exchange you’re currently using. Sent BTC to Cake (or LTC, BCH, Doge). As long as the value is above US$50 you will get the bonus.  You can then swap your BTC for DFI on Cake.   Do not send ETH or other ERC-20 tokens, those require a pretty high one time US$130 gas fee for address creation.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167725)
