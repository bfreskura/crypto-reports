1. **nami, sundae, swap**

    @MrBrinker --- *I would download CCvault and restore your wallet there, it has been best wallet handling the load. No one charged you 5 ADAs, it is the collateral and as soon as you remove it your Ada is back. Check Sundae’s Discord or Twitter for tutorials on how to setup CCvault* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774636)

    @Gr33nSun --- *Now both swaps are "Price outside range" and my ADA has not been returned to my Nami wallet! BS! And charged me 5 ADA (for the 2or3rd time) ! WTF?! Now swap price almost 3x'-5x's $ from where I started ... where is my f'ing ADA? I've been patient 3+ yrs and this is what it is ???* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774537)

    @shirazaahmed --- *Hi Can someone please help. Im using Daedalus Wallet and I redelegated on Friday to another pool "North" to earn SundaeSwap Rewards. Its been 3 days and the Pool to which Im delegated to says "Unknown". Any idea whats going on?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775039)

    @Gr33nSun --- *Already have that. Now the amount from my Nami wallet has disappeared in the same amount that was trying to process from two days ago but it’s not showing up on Sundae swap as complete and that was after I click confirm to send a small portion to the Covalt wallet to interact with dapps.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774494)

    @gmark --- *Any updates/news how cardano team plan to address to fix this ‘3rd gen’, ‘peered reviewed network’ and not be congested - ‘it was a single Dex that launched’, so how we expect to sustain scalability? Does anyone feel we need an update as did not expect it to be this bad from my end?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774793)

    @drigo101 --- *Anyone trying to DM you is with 99.999% certainty a scammer* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774560)

4. **chain, improvements, network**

    @CalusB --- *What embarrassment ? Chain is running great. It’s literally at max and I can send and receive transactions in minutes still. Even sundae swap transactions are reasonable still. And all at decent cost. Considering this is all done with almost no improvements it’s quite impressive* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774798)

    @Lgbeano --- *@CalusB : Once these improvements come in we can be sure even higher transaction volumes will at most be a mild inconvenience and not break the chain like Sol or the ridiculous fees in eth I have eth positions on chain I literally can’t unwind because it would cost more then it’s worth* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774805)

    @CalusB --- *Are you serious? Have you been living under a rock they have launched like 3 blog posts multiple videos and there are improvements coming in both the February hard fork and June hard fork as well as improvements in node and block size in the coming weeks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774794)

    @CalusB --- *Wow this auto bot is kinda insane. Both our competitors have issues with super high volume either completely rendering the chain unusable or fees so high that it’s virtually unusable for regular transactions* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774802)

    @glitch04 --- *94% / 94% still room but there are backlogs depending on what you are using* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774674)

    @Chinerians --- *I think it is just super congested the network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774644)

5. **order, cancel, collateral**

    @gauthamnag --- *I tried but still can't cancell* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/774445)
