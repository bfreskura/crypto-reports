    @FelixAdi --- *Hey guys, I have a problem. Anyway I was in the process of transferring my metamask to ledger nano s, and I'm about all done besides my AVAX. So I tested a small amount, it shows both in wallet and app and snowtrace, then I transferred my full amount. After that I find out somehow there's a bug with metamask and I can't access that avax, it's giving enable smart contract error (it's already enabled ofc),,, I contacted metamask support already and filed a ticket but not confident they will get back to me quickly. Is there any way I can access that AVAX? I tried different PC, different metamask, same bug.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324191)

    @Vico007 --- *This chat is for avalanche topics* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324183)

    @M_OEZ --- *Hi guys. When I talk to people outside of the Avalanche world I often hear saying Avalanche is also not capable to proceed very high volume of transactions so they will get to a limit at some time. Do you maybe have a paper or an article etc. where these concerns are clarified ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324047)

    @Cody_0x --- *My understanding is Avalanche actually solves scalability issues with its 3 tier blockchain technology. If I search avalanche scalability issues I only find information on how it solves this problem.   It makes me think these concerns may come from competitors who are scared?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324048)

    @ersintaskin --- *At Dextools the #1 hot token traded on Avalanche is $HeC. It surpasses even stable coins. It is a GameFirst GameFi project. I think this shows that GameFi 2 and Metaverse can stand against the bear and really good projects with great teams that can deliver long term GameFirst vision can decouple from BTC. It also shows that GameFi may be really taking off on Avalanche.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324110)

    @iwouldbediogenes --- *I think you can check the official Avalanche website, where you can find all the info you need my friend* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324052)
