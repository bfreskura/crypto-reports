    @tornadotrading --- *but if there is some fed news item, and it becomes clear, that Russia is not, we could see a strong spike up on the sp500, and then crypto will follow , which could lead to another (feeble) shortlived rally* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/719177)

    @tornadotrading --- *but yeah, I have to admit that trading crypto has become way more difficult, as it follows the SP500* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/719386)
