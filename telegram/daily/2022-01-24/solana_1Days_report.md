    @nizzux --- *I think Is down. Based on reddit community* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/916078)

    @chillcrypto3 --- *What a disgrace having my post removed for making a prediction. Not a good look just means you have something to hide. Face the facts having continuous outages means you have problems. Please answer as to how you expect to fix this and make it slightly more realible? Anything please this is frustrating.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/916403)

    @taaisen --- *An inconsistent, unreliable network isn’t though. How will the team fix that?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/916149)

3. **solana, decentralized, lending**

    @Dirk --- *Can't even compare Cardano and Solana. Cardano is one of the most if not the most decentralized blockchain running. It's a true decentralized blockchain that was developed with years of academic rigor.  Alana is not decentralized certainly not in the way that cryptocurrency supposed to be.  The problems Solana is facing are directly on the Solana blockchain. Sunday swap is a DEX on the cardano network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/917074)

    @tommasooo05 --- *Guys do you think thath thee technical problems that solana has had in the last period could cause damage in the market in the long run?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/916771)

    @mahib45 --- *Hello 👋  Any Projects can build on Solana but Solana doesn't offer any endorsement or investment advice.  Do your own research! Thanks for the understanding ❤* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/915192)

    @UnknownIdentity --- *Even the usdc is on solana network. Huge projects are on it how it is dead . Just asking . Really meaningless if we think it is dead . Solana will be future i hope ...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/916116)

    @Parthimc84 --- *Ups and downs are a part of project life cycle, sure solana will bounce back stronger* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/916145)

    @nofearnickishere --- *You should read about SBF and the future of Solana.  Theres no point in debating if you honestly believe Solana is hype and VCs will abandon it.  That’s about as ignorant to the facts as you could get…  The market tanked, but if you educate yourself and do the research you’ll see nothing has changed for Solana. They are loaded, growing like no other, and killing it.  Solana is on course  to be the most useful utility blockchain in crypto period. Decentralized chains cannot compete if they are not as fast, secure and convenient.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/916703)

    @Sevith --- *He's specifically referring to the development of bitcoin.  I have already stated this several times;.....................  DECENTRALIZATION ONLY HAS TO DO WITH THE GEOPHRAPHICAL NETWORK DISTRIBUTION OF NODES IN A PARTICULAR SYSTEM; Nothing more; Nothing less.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/917170)

    @Sevith --- *Jonny ELI5 decentralization for me then.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/917180)

    @Kbs --- *Decentralised means not government by central Bank or any organisation or person... It runs autonomously without any control or authority .... Centralised is opposite run by someone authority* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/917125)
