    @XRP_Saitama --- *Regulations will be this year. SEC case ends this year. If ripple wins or settles we’ll see a reversal* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3045229)

    @Vincent758 --- *The biggest mistake ripple labs will make is to have their central office in Dubai UAE.  I've lived in Dubai for over 10 year's & their law changes like the weather.  I would totally avoid UAE & the rest of the middle east. The only reason why UAE is encouraging Crypto is because they are heavily in debt due to the Expo 2020 disaster.  Most people trading crypto will have their Crypto & assets seized in UAE. Mark it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044659)
