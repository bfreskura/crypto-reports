1. **chart, data, fix**

    @Mojomagick --- *Please can you fix or tell me what the issue is:  The chart for AVT a few times wicks have been removed after a few days. This has happened on several different occassions for a few weeks.  For example yesterday  Price went to $1.82 But today that price was removed from the chart. Even though 2 transactions at that price are still on the transaction log under the chart.  https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0xcdff6ddfc9e4807c9927fd58708c2ef3484cc305  @napascual* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321028)

    @napascual --- *Nothing to fix there. A candle normalization has already been done, those candles just cannot be avoided. That's just blockchain data. You can still stretch the candles to display the chart dates you're interested in.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320928)

    @wealthyhobo --- *Fix the chart for ANTIS Inu, someone added liquidity before the launch date to sabotage it, and we need that resolved ASAP.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320916)

    @Reza --- *Please look at the full chart... There is a big red candle that occurred prior to launching. It's inaccurate and misleading. Please take appropriate action, as this can be detrimental.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321044)

    @gumbercules --- *As stated...no action can be taken. That's the data that's been picked up from when the token was launched* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321045)

    @wealthyhobo --- *If you zoom out of the chart you will see a massive red candle way before that current chart. The first green candle you see is the actual day the project was launched* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320931)

2. **dext, dex, info**

    @JoeyDieleman --- *Yeah thats sad, the whole purpose of DexTools if to give you info to not fall for scams, only buys, low score no public contract should give people red flags, of course even then dextools can never be 100% accurate, there will always be a fight between detecting scams and scammers comming up with new things. Please use dextools as intended and always do extra research on top of that. See the socials and check those too (and don'y fall for bots saying all the time the project is awesome and 100x is the only way). But for the tokens you gave, Dextools is pretty clear.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321274)

    @dazedcrypto --- *how does your advertising work ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321285)

    @cyK3r --- *Hi, I have a question. We launched Dragon Infinity 2 months ago and we had an issue, as we did it again under Dragon Infinity v2.. and we had an issue again. We will launch on Monday once again. My question is, can we hide the other two from Dex so it doesn't show anymore? We want to use Dragon Infinity as name.. On poocoin it works after a while, but on dex, it still shows. And we don't want our investors to look or buy the wrong token.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320320)
