1. **wallet, firefly, staking**

    @ef4ort --- *What i mean is that  if you are not seeing it in your wallet its just as bad as you not having it the first place . and the evidence of convincing them without an email confirming the staking will be hard to prove even with the screenshot* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305485)

    @ef4ort --- *But what evidence can the  crypto holder present to show there was a previous staking that disappeared except screen captures.  and what is he gurantee they will honor that  ? thanks for your contribution* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305483)

    @ef4ort --- *But if that happens and you restore your wallet using your mnemonic phrase you should be able to get everything back as it was when u staked it with your staking rewards intact   i would expect but my friend found an empty wallet still showing no trace at all of any transactions whatsoever.. Could that have been an external intrusion happening within the last 24 hours while NY festivities was ongoing ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305465)

    @Jul_Y5 --- *Crypto wallets are like web browsers. They only show what is on the server / blockchain. So if one restore his wallet he have to be able to see his funds as they were before.

    @ElmettS96 --- *This things undoubtedly, but the question is if there is a real manipulation perpetrated by Binance (if yes how they can do that) or there are just a few holders that want to sell (not related to Binance)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305418)

    @lalit1414 --- *We are close to breakout the price but need one hard hit.. not possible without new buyers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305573)

    @satoshi_legend --- *Just put a sell order, much bigger than the market demand - and the demand will not be able to penetrate that level of equilibrium.  That said, it could be a few big individuals and not even Binance that is involved in this sell order.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305420)
