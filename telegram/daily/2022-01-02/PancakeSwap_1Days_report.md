9. **wallet, pancakeswap, metamask**

    @M2C6L --- *Unfortunately, my problem has still not vanished 😏 I've now made a screenshot to make my question a little more visual. I'm relatively new to the defi area and of course I don't want to lose my money but increase it ... 😁 As I said, I had already played around with Pancakeswap a few weeks ago to get to know the platform a little better. At that time I had a Binance Extension Wallet connected to Pancakeswap. All I had to do was connect the Binance Extension Wallet to Pancakeswap, activate my selected pool in the SyrupPool, use CAKE and that was it. But now I was advised to buy a ledger, connect it to the metamask and then connect Pancakeswap to the metamask. (☝️For security reasons ☝️) Probably, some of you are throwing yourself into the corner laughing because my question "stupid" seems to you ... 😅 But I still hope that someone here would like to answer my question..😊* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2238580)

    @Ceddi200 --- *👉Try trustwallet or safepal is work on 100%👈  ✅ Metamask - PC ✅ Safepal - iphone ✅ Trustwallet - android  Don't use metamask with phone ❌ Don't use trust with ios ❌ Don't use Binance wallet with pc ❌ ---------------------------------------------------  You can import your wallet to any other wallets that works with Pancakeswap if you want. You can continue to use same wallet with your seed. That seed is not special for safepal or trust wallet or metamask. You can use it in any wallet app  You will write the seed words to new app with choosing "I have already a wallet" or " Import Wallet"   Binance Smart Wallet ➜  Metamask  Guide👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻 https://youtu.be/rGhedOxzJEc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2237785)

    @M2C6L --- *Hello everyone and a happy new year, I have a question. I have connected my ledger to Pancakeswap via the metamask and now want to stake my CAKE in the SyrupPool, it says "Add to metamask" on the right and "activate" on the left. "Add to metamask" is written even though I have already connected my ledger to Pancakeswap via metamask. Some time ago I connected my Binance expansion wallet to Pancakeswap. Back then, staking in the SYRUP pool was very easy. I just had to connect my Binance Extension Wallet to Pancakeswap, activate the pool where I wanted to stake and then just use my CAKE. Why is it different with the metamask? Thank you for your help in advance.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2238209)
