    @A11997700 --- *Im not sure to be honest. I Participated on TronPad.Network ido.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3804473)

    @Gasperinix --- *I tried but my post was deleted ... I got a link about tron and I wanted to know if it is legit* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3802664)

    @agentpiki --- *Did you know:  There are fake XRPs, fake ADAs, fake SHIBs, fake DOGEs   most of which in TRC10 form.   BSC and TRC are not interchangeable* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3802287)

    @Xieon1 --- *I know both of that. What threw me is that official website lists the TRN token ID as their official ID and their pancake swap for that chain.   I don't think it's a fake token like the others, maybe a slick way to drive up hype, but a ton of users will eventually come to them and say hey you said token #xxxx is official on Tron...whats going on.   I'll update you as I contacted them* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3802293)

4. **airdrop, token, pal**

    @Hiffeh --- *Pls I have not gotten the token..why* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3801813)

    @Xieon1 --- *Yes, I know, I don't know if you know much about PAL, but it's actually a legit project, traded on BSC, and it's out of India.   I got airdropped the tokens worthless in August, then last month they became worth a lot, according to safepal still are.   Not sure what the end game was? Tokens you can't sell and didn't buy? Very strange to me.  But not going to beat a dead horse, thanks for talking 2 me about it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3802280)

    @Xieon1 --- *Unfortunately Sunswap, and the one you listed dont have it listed, and theres a lot of mis info about it.   Sometimes people say it's worthless because I didn't trade it to dextrade in time becausse they were a sponsored exchange.   Just frustrating when I open my acccounts on Safepal and see hundrends in PAL(TRN-10) token and nothing to do with it :(* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3802265)

    @Lekco_23 --- *There's tron airdrop live now ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3803140)

    @Xieon1 --- *It says it's worth quite a bit but theres no way to do anything with it? I got it airdroped for staking a while back?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3802246)

DEVELOPERS OF TRONLINK THERE IS HUGE UX PROBLEM IN YOUR CHROME EXTENSION when you click tether asset on tronlink there is an address which is clickable, has copy button. people mistakenly understands that it is their address but its actually contract address. why do you even make a copy icon on contract address?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3802753)

    @Travis --- *well then you know the problem w the tronwatch wallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3803630)

    @Travis --- *also,  the tronwatch wallet was completely shelved by the same developers as the tronlink wallet but the integration of the two is non existent.  too bad i forgot to get back to this issue a year or so ago and it would be easier but as it stands, tronwatch wallet gave shitty mnemonics and the keystore or the private key will not unlock my tokens.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3803556)

    @Xieon1 --- *All of the chains need to increase the cost to pull these scams. BSC Is so cheap I have like trillions of scam tokens.   Dont get those on ETH anymore because of the gas fee to pull scam.   Wish there was some way to deal with all these scams and crap.
