    @Avaunt --- *L1 native crypto are generally referred to as 'coins'. XRD is a coin, eXRD is a token. But people quite often use either to describe the same thing.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331497)

    @Patrotheman --- *Hey guys a quick question, why do all projects in Radix looks like scam projects? Oci swap sounds like a meme and Doge 3 cerby… all looks like shitcoins! Why there is no serious projects? Jus a concern* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331011)

    @Steve7555 --- *Radix is clearly very advanced. But I just wonder who it will be used by. Are banks and institutions etc waiting on the sidelines?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331122)

    @Eggplanteddie --- *Hey guys, having problems logging into my wallet. Password is 100% correct. Just nothing happens when I try to login.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331928)

    @Magal36 --- *If you can't go past the login, then what's left is to try a VPN from another region. The funds are safe and the network is functional, but indeed this wallet issue is a pain. If you can't try the VPN I suggest you wait a bit* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331306)

    @momoreina --- *Yeah the thing is that I can't login. I put in my pass and it just stays in the login page* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331360)

    @Cpt_Charles --- *#walletissue - If you are having issues connecting with the Radix wallet, you can try to use an alternative community node in the wallet settings (see image for example)  Archive Node Addresses: https://radixtalk.com/t/what-community-archive-nodes-can-i-use-with-the-radix-desktop-wallet/156  Explorer Alternatives: https://radixscan.io* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331933)

    @Bernardo --- *I believe in the vision and the fundamental (unbridgeable?) advantage in programmability and scalability.  But we need to prove that we can release quality code into the mainnet.  Consistently.  I believe we will and therefore I am staking a lot, but many large investors are not convinced yet.  Which might be ok, I guess…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331603)

    @MattToTheMoon --- *My vpn isn’t working either despite it being located in Austria. Bitfinex was still picking up my actual location. Either bitfinex upped their game or the vpn isn’t configured to mask your location.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331509)

    @pastet89 --- *OK... I downloaded ProtonVPN but the free version provides just Netherlands, USA, Japan. Is it even worth trying with those?

8. **archive, archive nodes, archive node**

    @Magal36 --- *it's new years eve gguys. I wouldn't be looking into it if I were the team 😂😂😂 Funds are safu, consensus is working fine, just switch to a community archive node and you'll be ok* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/330901)

    @fpieper --- *https://status.radixdlt.com/  when will the current issues with the archive nodes be resolved?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331389)

    @Ashley --- *Read the pinned message, you need to change the archive node on the main net to one of the given trusted community archive nodes* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331553)

    @Frosties --- *Archive node is probably updating switch to another node as per Avaunts posts above* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331372)

9. **archive, node, archive node**

    @Magal36 --- *nope, I just noticed by the amount of people in here. But be sure the issue is only with archive nodes, validators are doing their job, consensus is fine, funds are safu* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/330806)

    @Radstakes --- *All of the community archive nodes listed here are from well known validators and radvocates which should give some peace of mind.  https://radixtalk.com/t/what-community-archive-nodes-can-i-use-with-the-radix-desktop-wallet/156?u=faraz.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331102)

    @ahsimon --- *Its a good question, but one I don't expect a definitive answer to until we are closer to Xi'an release.  Only with Xi'an is your scenario of 10,000 nodes even possible.  My best guess is that Xi'an will come with a whole new approach for validator and archive node business models.  And we will learn more about them as we approach 2023 EOY, and will have plenty of time to discuss before it is used.  One possible approach makes your questions moot.  Specifically one can allow any wallet owner to be responsible for their own node functionality.  That way you don't have to "trust" a validator or archive node you probably know nothing about.  You just have to trust that the code that allows you to upgrade to a new wallet has been audited, and has some form of spoof-proof update process, perhaps using a 2FA.    One future difference in the validator/node/archive model could be that it does not depend on 24/7 availability of your built-in node.  If you close your wallet when you are done with it, either for security reasons or to save battery life on your mobile, you have to anticipate some delay between when you load your wallet the next time and when it is ready for full use again.  During this delay your local archive node re-synchs with the Radix ledger before you can use it again.  You can avoid this start-up delay by keeping your wallet open until you are no longer actively using it.  I think you can see this effect today when you use https://radix.stream/.  I remember seeing it on some older software wallets I have used sporadically, such as iirc Daedalus.  The only other approach I know of is to provide some financial incentive for third party "trusted" node runners to run a 24/7 archive node (or load balanced archive node pool) for you (and others).  That is, for a zero delay archive node service to be self-supporting those users who want it must somehow pay for it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331557)

    @Peter (HAM) --- *Okay, I got that. But what can happen when using a bad guys archive node?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331103)

    @MassieFur --- *Im not sure. But I believe you could trust most validators if not all* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331047)

    @Magal36 --- *Yes, they are trusted nodes runned by the community* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/330838)

    @pastet89 --- *Another use reported the same issue* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331318)

    @AndreVon777 --- *That's good to know! I'll just wait for the issue to be resolved rather than try it myself. Don't want to break anything* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/331283)

    @Tokyorider1611 --- *ok good, then the problem is not on my side* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/330699)

    @Blake --- *Read above. Someone posted a solution already* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/330785)
