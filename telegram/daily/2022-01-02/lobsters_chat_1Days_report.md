    @PmRiviere --- *thanks that explains the trick wonderfully. TIL Etherscan presently do not show cross-contract calls which sends 0 value. good to know!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311984)

    @ivangbi --- *Tbh a good level of ctrl+f + @coine_r replies work for this, some back from crypto code reviews* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312121)

4. **duck, potatoes, later**

    @ivangbi --- *Since this is a food channel tonight (ok fine!) I made a duck (+ there was a bunch of other stuff). There were roasted potatoes and stuff next to it later on. Messed up the skin a bit on the other side (not as crispy as would have liked). And no that is NOT A PENES but its neck.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311880)

    @Sunny --- *Looks dank af otherwise, what sauces going with it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311889)

    @river0x --- *Will be putting a lot of soup on this 🤠* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311908)

    @Caleb3th --- *Trick is in this tx: https://etherscan.io/address/0xd3c751aed3e0b6fef180bca7a98893c976df1665/advanced#internaltx  The answer was updated before the quiz started - So it isn't "lunch and dinner" but some other keccaked text* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311982)

    @Sunny --- *All that juice down below can be used later, its heavily fatty and would be bomb af in potatoes later or like you could collect it in a mason jar and make a candle out of it to light at parties of people you don't like and their house will smell of duck forever* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311897)

    @ivangbi --- *Just regular cranberry, no gravy (was lazy). Turned out aight, firs time making a duck (usually chicken). But roasted apples and potatoes were gud. Why the aluminum at the bottom btw?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311892)

5. **cosmos, polkadot, substrate**

    @Swader --- *No, Cosmos is very much a chain, a hub bridging other chains.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312104)

    @Swader --- *Substrate is the framework on which Polkadot and Kusama are built, yes.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312099)

    @tatai_007 --- *Also, I don't know why this never comes on Google when I searched for Cosmos vs polkadot comparison. Explains most of my doubts pretty well.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312110)

    @tatai_007 --- *So this is where I get confused about Cosmos all the time, I thought Cosmos was just an SDK that you can use to create blockchains. It doesn't have a chain itself.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312103)

    @Swader --- *No no, Polkadot is directly comparable to Cosmos. Cosmos is a product on whatever they use for development, Tendermint + Cosmos SDK. Polkadot is a product on Substrate.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312101)

    @Swader --- *Cosmos is built on its own SDK/tech, just like Polkadot is on Substrate* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312105)

6. **l1 researchers, l1, researchers**

    @Swader --- *There is a pretty okay comparison in the wiki https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-comparisons-cosmos* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312102)

    @Alphamint --- *What's a good channel with L1 researchers? For someone who has semi noob Qs* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312120)
