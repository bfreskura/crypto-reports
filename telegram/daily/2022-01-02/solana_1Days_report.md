    @Llyonsa --- *It might not necessarily be Solana but yes, even with v2 etherium will have its limitations and be surpassed.... eventually. It will be likely be a combination of new L1 projects like dusk, hedera, Solana etc which eat into Etherium over the years until better tech comes out... probably an evolution of hashgraph* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/887065)
