2. **apy, 5280, year**

    @nfwaple --- *assuming 5280% APY for the entire year and you don't withdraw any of them for an entire year, your total OHM would be 3 OHM x 52.80, but it doesn't make sense to be assuming that APY does not change for one whole year* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/140275)

    @miansatar --- *How we calculate profit at 5280% APY* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/140262)

5. **gohm, index, current index**

    @TurboLaserClip --- *like, is there a calculator to check what could be liquidation price if borrowed 20% of total collateral, where could i check in the UI where exactly to repay and  in general how does it feel to use rari with gohm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/139730)

    @Max --- *gohm = current index x ohm price. The amount of your gohm won't grow but the value of gohm will* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/139875)

    @nfwaple --- *Gohm price = ohm price x current index, and not sure how you get the 14%...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/140222)

    @CryptoCobiUSA --- *I wish there is just simply a function to see the value . My gOHM stays the same ... So where does it actually compound ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/140179)

    @nfwaple --- *we used to use that 9,9 calculator, but obviously since gOHM is the collateral now, it might affect the calculation abit, you can save a copy and make changes manually though* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/139736)

    @CryptoCobiUSA --- *Yeah I see that but it does stay the same. The gOHM value does not move* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/140175)

6. **avax, gohm, swap**

    @nfwaple --- *use the wrap function on the website to unwrap it, but you can't unwrap on AVAX because sOHM only exists on ETH chain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/140185)

    @J. --- *Hi all! Can you please help me here? I can't vote on snapshot even though I have gOHM. Is it because I have it on AVAX chain and not on ERC20?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/139608)

    @B --- *So yeah I didn't know that. Because I still have a few sohms in the stake should I then take them and swap them in gohm? and what would be the cheapest way to get to gohm now?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/139533)

    @Ian --- *Get Avax then swap to gohm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/140370)

    @CryptoCobiUSA --- *That's prob why, I am on AVAX* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/140184)

    @Ap0l1o --- *Traderjoe, swap it for avax to gOhm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/139783)
