    @Luke --- *I found staking via spookyswap to be easiest, you’ll need to stake as a pair (ftm-boo for example) though. Same with Tomb finance.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619939)

    @jaywillizigah --- *Yah, it's possible to stake ftm on waykichain,  Don't know if the team are planning on integrating ftm on the waykichain network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619831)

    @pako --- *Hello everyone, does anyone know anything about FANTOM LAUNCH (FTML) and the team behind it because I can't find anything ???* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619580)

    @Janevietani --- *why dont bridge BNB BEP20 to BNB Fantom then you can swap BNB Fantom for FTM on spookyswap later* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620311)

    @Paper_Prophet --- *Need to bridge some ETH from fantom to etherium. What’s the best cheapest way please?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620475)

    @Janevietani --- *example bridge BNB BEP20 to BNB Fantom with https://spookyswap.finance/bridge* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620318)

    @ColinClark --- *Thanks, it’s just so frustrating, Fantom Is a great project and starting to fly, I get so frustrated when everything I do with the erc20 costs money or is so awkward.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620240)

4. **metamask, mainnet, withdraw**

    @Alberto --- *My FTM on metamask are shown as BNB ... and all transactions fails* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619918)

    @Matthew_Lockie --- *Native ftm withdrawal fee is 1ftm if open. 15 ftm fee is for erc20 ftm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620209)

    @ColinClark --- *Yes mainnet withdrawals when their not shut ? Hardly great. Your missing the point. Surely FTM should be standalone and have the direct facility so we don’t need to wait when it suits exchanges, spend additional monies to bridge, exchange, wrap etc etc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620230)

    @pajamasfreak --- *Binance, bitfinex, gate.io, kucoin and huobi do have mainnet withdrawal. Metamask or any other wallets are the same, different networks have different fees.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620228)

    @pnxjkeee --- *Guys is there is anyway to not pay 15 ftm gas for transferring form kucoin to MetaMask?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620193)

    @pnxjkeee --- *So if I want to withdraw to MetaMask opera mainnet I need to choose native ftm ? Or erc 20?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620210)

5. **coinbase, funds, network**

    @officially_jason --- *But the transfer is not in the Coinbase wallet so I don’t understand why Fantom Foundation can’t help retrieve since it’s still on Fantom network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619488)

    @Mcjig --- *save your tx hash, and if coinbase ever does support usdc on fantom network/ then it can be fixed* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619454)

    @Mcjig --- *sorry, but fantom cant help. only the owner of the receiving address can access it. since coinbase doesnt support usdc on fantom network they cant access it. and there is no way for fantom to access a wallet owned by coinbase* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619451)

    @officially_jason --- *Hola Fantom Fam. I made a pretty big mistake sending USDC from Metmask Fantom Opera to my Coinbase USDC wallet address. I have it showing success on FTM scan. However the transfer never showed up in Coinbase. I asked coinbase to help retreive the funds and they said it's not a network they support and I need to reach out to Fantom @FantomianBot* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619447)

    @pajamasfreak --- *Of course we couldn’t help that. It was sent to one of coinbase custodian wallet which they own, it is a valid tx under different network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619489)

    @pajamasfreak --- *Basically they just don’t give that kind of service. Save your tx hash until they support that* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619457)

6. **days, lock, period**

    @Quantanamoto👻 --- *You will get a penalty if you unstake before the end of the locking period.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620520)

    @Mcjig --- *use the staking calculator at website/ your restake gets whatever the rate is for time left. so whatever 6 months pay is* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619615)

    @Nida --- *For staking locking period, does everyone choose the max (like 200+ days) to get the high apr, and then you can unstake at any time , only 7 days ???* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620512)

    @Nida --- *Like say I plan to stake for 30 days, should I still choose 365 days, just to get highest APR* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620513)

    @r --- *Hi is there any advantage if I lock delegation ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619962)
