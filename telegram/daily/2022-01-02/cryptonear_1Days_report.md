    @Rom --- *You should calm down mate, crypto in general are in the early phase like internet was 30 years ago, at that time you had to use command line just to send an email nowadays you can send one with a swipe of one finger. It takes times to create easy interaction. If you cannot accept this fact then just wait for it to be more mature but you will miss the huge opportunities of being an early investor. Thats your choice to make but please stop with your hate. People do no exist to satisfy your needs, you have to adapt yourself to reality, the other way around won't happen so learn to do your own research and learn patience you need it it seems* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/257911)
