1. **claim, rewards, reinvest**

    @appliepietrade --- *now let me ask you another question. There is an option for reinvest for the staking reward. I don't quite understand it. Let's say I staked 1000 dyp and i have 10 dyp for the rewards, if I click reinvest, does this 10 dyp add back to the 1000 to get the compound?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235831)

    @robertqin86 --- *I just reinvested so I can answer this qn. Ur stake amt after reinvesting is 1010 dyp. If u are eligible to withdraw after ur lock in period it will also be 1010. Do note that reinvesting will require eth gas fees so do ur own calculations on when is the best time to reinvest.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235832)

    @appliepietrade --- *thanks sir!  I understand that reinvesting will need gas fee, so I will definitely take this into account when I do reinvest. Now thank you very much for answering my question. Happy new year to you Sir!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235836)

The usdt token address i try to add is this:0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235889)
