    @DeeSingh0000 --- *Mate I’m not doing it on purpose… I have something called APENFT in my wallet, that’s why I’m asking about it in this group. This group is called NFT, and I’m talking about APENFT  I was trying to find out what it was, maybe an airdropped NFT. But I still don’t know it is and your no help. The community has been trying to help me by answering my questions. But clearly you won’t, your just giving me warnings.   Maybe be more helpful* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/422010)
