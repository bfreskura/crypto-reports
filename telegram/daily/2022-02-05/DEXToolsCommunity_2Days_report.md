    @Robertkaz --- *I have a token created lp added but not showing on dextools* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/331295)

    @stanes --- *It's not how it works: We index all the pairs present on the DEXs we support. Once again: there is no listing process. We give some tools to users to downvote a pair if they think it's a scam. When you are interacting with some DEXs, you have to be extremely careful, most of the coins are scams or will anyway be valueless in the future.  Always DYOR, apeing any token without knowing anything about it is throwing your money away.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/331144)

    @napascual --- *There are 1M tokens around, you need to DYOR. Dextools metrics are automatic checks, they help you out, but won’t advise you to buy a token* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330766)
