    @Lgbeano --- *Depends whether your other wallet is delegated or not. You register the wallets staking key, so anything in there is delegated.   If you move your ₳ from one staked wallet to another, your old wallet will continue receiving the rewards from that ₳ for three epochs, before your new wallet takes over. So you never lose out on rewards* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778529)

    @Sydney --- *It was my understanding though that not every slot was filled with a block before* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778580)
