    @Ismailbaskn0 --- *Why did you and your team decide to build Monsterra? #Monsterra* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/445291)

    @thangmd --- *The game set foot in a fictional world and revolves around farming, property building, and battling other lands with the magical creatures named Mongen. The design of Monsterra combines the free-to-play and free-to-earn model, which allows millions of gaming enthusiasts fun and profit with no initial investment. To make it clear, we can say that Monsterra prioritizes developing the game to elevate user experience: attractive graphics, diverse missions, addictive gameplay from food production, animal breeding to building your own land, entering fierce battle modes from leading troops to conquering new lands, beating dreadful bosses, raiding other players' lands and confronting forces head-on other real player's troops. Thus, we think Monsterra will be able to attract many more players to come in the long term.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/445210)

    @thangmd --- *That's the motivation for us to build Monsterra which is the first premium game in our Monsterra Universe with various innovative solutions to the existing problems above. - Free-To-Play-To-Earn Game Mechanics: Monsterra lets gamers experience a full-fledged core game for free before actually spending on it. In other words, players can enjoy the farming and nurturing ecosystem in Monsterra for free first. Once they find the game addictive and worth investing in, they can spend their money on it afterward. - Play-For-Fun Game Model: Monsterra elevates the game-fun aspect with exciting and inspiring gameplay. We offer an interesting farming ecosystem and 4 fierce battle modes for users to enter with different rewarding structures and battle formats. - Balanced In-Game Economy: Monsterra is well designed with an innovative dual token model to slow down inflation and sustain the in-game balance. We try to keep a balanced amount between the minted and burned in-game token so that the game ecosystem can stay healthy for years to come. - Gas Fee Solution: Users pay no gas fee when getting started with Monsterra game. They will only be charged for transaction fee when converting their assets into NFT items.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/445213)

    @thangmd --- *With Monsterra, our team strives to deliver a revolutionary P2E game that transforms existing Play-to-earn games into the fun zone.   Monsterra sets itself apart from other P2E games with several USPs: - Unprecedented Breeding Mechanism: Players can create new animals with different figures by breeding 2 random entities of in-game creatures. Monsterra character set, therefore, will be unique Mongens collectibles with infinite diversity. - Unique Land Shaping and Customization Mechanics: Gamers can customize their own lands to create different shapes. This elevates the individuality and uniqueness in each player’s land. - Varied Land Theme: In Monsterra, it is easy to modify land themes according to different seasons  (Merry Christmas, Halloween, etc). The brand identities of Monsteras’ partners (investors, marketing partners, etc) can also be embedded in the land plots - Innovative Token & NFT Staking: Players will gain enticing rewards and shared revenue from the staking activities in Monsterra. On top of that, the tokens and NFTs assets that are already added in the staking pools can still be utilized in the in-game activities. Players can also enjoy a lower or no gas fee if they utilize those tokens or NFTs in in-game activities.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/445215)
