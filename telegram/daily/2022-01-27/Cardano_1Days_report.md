    @Lgbeano --- *That pool is over saturated but you can still add ₳. I'm not sure if they will be included in their ispo or not, you would need to ask the sundaeswap team.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775772)

4. **improvements, epochs, ipso**

    @apex_pool_spo --- *no, where did you get that impression from? it is actually going to be worse for a period, when other DEXes will also lunch, but in a few months (my expectation) we will see some big improvements. there is also a hard fork schedules for February (theoretically), I am not sure if the CIP31, CIP32 and CIP33 will be included or not. If yes, we will see the improvements much sooner.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775810)

    @Lgbeano --- *Yeah they only ran their ispo for 5 epochs* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775768)

    @KyR14c0s --- *yes but it took much more time than other days ... they were not supposed to fix this in this epoch ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775809)

    @ZeroOne101 --- *does anyone have thoughts on them only ipso'in for 5 epochs ? compared to most other projects length , and also considering the hype , that this is a pretty measly offering , no ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775777)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *there was a parameter change, but it was something minor, we won't see noticeable improvements from that (my personal guess).* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775812)

    @Barbedouce --- *Hi, i'm using in the same time CCVault mainnet & testnet. I connect to minswap on testnet, then sundaeswap mainnet. When i do this, there is a mistake : minswap switch to mainnet, with the wallet i chose for sundaeswap. I think this kind of mistake can lead to some people lossing funds. Be carefull.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775893)
