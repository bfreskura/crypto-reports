    @abovyanv --- *Option A: Keeping the current system. The Governance rewards amount for 2022 will be 282M Algos (70.5M per quarter) while maintaining the current simple locking mechanism: the rewards are distributed among the governors who vote and maintain the committed Algos in their wallet for the entire quarterly period. Governors failing to do so will lose their rewards, but will incur no further penalties.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/331768)
