    @RomainSwitzerland --- *Hi Lotto, You can find all official updates from Chainlink here* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/362680)

    @r0derik --- *hi all, I'm trying to have a local setup for a contract that uses a chainlink price oracle. I can make it work using hardhat mainnet forking. But at the same time I want to have blocks to automine every 2 seconds, for The Graph integrations. Those two conflict. I would like to try my contract without mainnet forking. But i would need to check some way in my contract if the pricefeed address is not a contract, to use a fixed value. Any idea how I can set this up?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/362261)

This presentation by Sergey discusses staking and the difference between implicit and explicit staking, while in this other presentation Sergey announced the team is planning to implement some form of staking in 2022.  As a rule the team doesn’t offer timelines for development targets. You can follow development progress via github.
