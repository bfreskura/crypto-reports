3. **ifo, cake, pool**

    @Frankjankjink --- *Chefs pls It's high time you make the requirements for IFO very strict, in order to reduce the number of participants. So that we can also have a meaningful IFO that is worth it.  1. Anyone without up to 1000points won't be able to participate in the IFO 2. You have to stake your cake for atleast 30days to be able to partake in the IFO 3. You must have atleast 3NFTs in your wallet to participate in the IFO. ETC.  These are samples on how to make the IFO strict. And It  definitely increase the price of cake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2260225)

    @dksbd --- *Cakes value going to down day by day* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2259752)

    @baby_planb --- *Every week around 10m cake supply more and they burn 6.5m and no more money coming to the cake so price slow go down down down like this they should bure more or add somthing to the exchange to money flw more to cake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2260411)

    @Salman --- *CAKE price is around 10.90$ and current total circulating supply is 257 Million. One  year ago when the price was around 40$ it had  total circulating supply of around 92 million CAKE.   The total circulating supply of CAKE has increased from around 92 m to 257m in roughly one year time frame. I also noticed that devs of pancake are constantly selling CAKE( which you can check on BSC scan that the top wallets are selling continuously) If the circulating supply was still same as of last year which was 92m then (current market cap 2.8 divided by total circulating supply 92m 2,800,000,000/92,000,000 = 30.43$ . In short if they wouldn’t had increased the circulating supply then the price would still be around 30$ today.   Good projects always burn the supply instead of increasing it and selling it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2261686)
