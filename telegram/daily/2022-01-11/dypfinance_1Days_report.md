    @Paulus --- *Yes and it auto switch about 25% to DYP. i mean what if we withdraw the DYP, does it affect the share* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238471)

    @Paulus --- *I know but what the APR for DYP? equal with LP* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238477)

    @Paulus --- *So it may lower than the LP APR then it may not attracting investors, we just wait till the lock time done then move as much as we can from DYP back to LP and keep DYP at minimum. Sound not so good for DYP right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238479)

4. **avax, assets, loss**

    @Craig --- *I understand that and the loss is not the reason for my post. I'm simply trying to learn more about IL and what market indicators I'm looking for to gauge it's impact.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238628)

    @Cryptomommi --- *Not spreading FUD. But I entered with $5000 WBNB pool Nov 26th and now my entire position is only worth $1,200....significant Impermanent Loss but that's the risk you take with DeFi liquidity protocols.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238606)

    @Craig --- *The AVAX price has dropped 25% since i provided my LP which equates to 1/4 of 1x. Reading your numbers I could expect to lose 25% of my assets in a year with a 5x UP or DOWN, and yet I've lost 18% in a month with only 1/4 of 1x drop in asset value. I don't follow.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238584)

    @WatermelonNoia --- *I dont think it will ever catch based on the AVAX component alone, as when you join the LP your AVAX stake is split up to purchase some DYP. You'll need DYP to increase to offset the IL you have experienced and comparing it to purely AVAX alone.  Please consider the payouts you get, as they close the gap between your initial investment, and any IL.  Profit or loss (@ a point in time) = initial capital - IL + payouts received.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238639)

    @Craig --- *I’ve been reading up on impermanent loss and have the gist of it. I do have a question though that I’m hoping someone can explain in layman’s terms. I’m going to use an actual DYP pool I’m in for this question. The pool is on the AVAX chain and I provided 57 AVAX for liquidity, a month ago, locked for three days.  Since that time the value of my LP, DYP and rewards is worth 12% less than if I just held the AVAX independent of the pool. I used today’s market price comparing the 57 AVAX versus adding up my LP, DYP and rewards. I’m not if mistaken the LP is 75% AVAX and 25% DYP. So here’s the question; in order for me to recoup the 12% loss, the market/assets need to improve, but if they’re improving in the pool, it also means the assets are improving outside of it. So how does that make up for the loss? That’s the part I can’t figure out so any help would be greatly appreciated* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238570)

    @Craig --- *I'm using the total value of all assets from the stats page. The total value is $4235. The value of my 57.477 AVAX on today's market would be $4832. So the total value of my liquidity is 12% less than the value of the 57.477 AVAX (today's pricing. Not the price when I began) at this point after one month and a 25% drop of the AVAX price. Trying to understand how those numbers work.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238589)
