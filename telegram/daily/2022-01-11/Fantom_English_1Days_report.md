5. **scam, seed, funds**

    @Mcjig --- *[Forwarded from Mcjigs(will never dm first)] Common sense rules to help protect your crypto 1. Never ever share your seed phrase( thats like giving your password to access your funds) 2. Admins or support will never private message you first If you receive a private message with offers to help 99% of the time its a scam 3. Best security is to use a cold wallet(ledger,trezor) 4. There is no such thing as visiting a website to resync or validate your wallet 5. 100% of the time. Issues can be fixed. Seed phrase is never required 6. Always write down your seed phrase and store in a safe place and download your keystore If you dont have either of those. Then you will never be able to access your funds 7. There are NO Airdrops. If your asked to send funds with a promise of more funds in return* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/627456)

    @ourmaninamsterdam --- *Sorry to hear it, was also tempted because it all looked pretty legit, lots of normal discussions, 80K members, very active… Pretty sophisticated scam!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/627527)

    @J92AF --- *A lot of new users fall for it and give up their seed or private key* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/627440)

6. **phantom, phantom chain, docs**

    @Drowsy17 --- *Be aware paint swap on phantom chain may have been compromised LP tokens are going missing all of mine have been stolen my whole entire list of coins has been drained to zero everything on the phantom chain is gone out of my meta mask so everybody be aware* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/627146)

    @delete0000000000 --- *and of course there's zero information anywhere on how to correctly merge the snapshot with geth, or "opera" but i've done that before.  docs are enough if you've done this before but new people are gonna have to read the ETH docs or something to even have a clue* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/626926)

    @Drowsy17 --- *Yes I've been doing this for years and I'm pretty experienced it was there on the 9th I went to bed and when I woke up this morning everything was gone and zeroed out on the phantom chain in my metamask wallet I went to paint swap farm and all of the LPs were cashed out and everything was exchanged for FTM and sent off* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/627166)

7. **stake, metamask, penalty**

    @Johnnyfantom --- *You can stake in the node through the fWallet or you can use Metamask in the ecosystem* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/627419)
