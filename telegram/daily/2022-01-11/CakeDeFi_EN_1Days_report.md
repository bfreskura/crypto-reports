1. **network, defichain, cake**

    @Sahin --- *So if I follow your info. Then for depositing Bitcoin to cake defi from binance. I choose the DFI network. For withdrawing btc to binance i choose the native network and that is BTC network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162808)

    @Sahin --- *Hello guys I still don't understand when to chose the right network... I think I might be stupid or something😜* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162803)

    @Sahin --- *This is the part where I am stuck. Because on cake for the defichain network it says. 'use this network to send to a defichain wallet'. Kucoin is not a defichain? The only defichain wallet I know is 'defichain wallet' on the Google play store.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162794)

    @Sahin --- *Thanks for the chart. I think I get it now. Last example. If I deposit Ethereum from an exchange to cake defi. Then I choose the native network and that is the Ethereum Network. When I move inside the defichain ecosystem than it is dfi network. When I withdraw Ethereum out of cake defi i need to use the native network and that is Ethereum Network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162813)

    @senfhend --- *Hey Team, does it work to send eth directly from cake to Bittrex? Since it is sent via smart contract…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163234)

    @Tomaz --- *Hello. Is it possible to transfer eth or usdt to defi chain wallet and back to cake? Is there than autoic change to deth and vice versa?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162996)

2. **freezer, 10, reduction**

    @Stephan --- *Ah I see now, thank you! So rewards will be quite small in a few years if we reduce them every cycle 🙁* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162938)

    @andreasisaak --- *You don't consider the reduction of block rewards that's happening over time to reduce inflation (similar to Bitcoin's halvings).* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162928)

    @Stephan --- *I see, but how come that reduction is so high? I would assume the last year (year 10) to yield most rewards, yet one basically makes no rewards in the calculation of the freezer for the last year.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162931)

    @Stephan --- *So that means 36*1.658% = ~50% APY that I esentially lose in a year? If I stake for 45% APY, don't I have a loss at the end of the year? Assuming everything stays constant, no price increase, no freezing etc.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162933)

    @Stephan --- *How exactly does the freezer calculation work? Seems super odd that the development of capital in DFI takes on a logarithmic function instead of an exponential one. Why would it start saturating after 10 years? Also, an APY of 100% is about 70% APR, yet Freezer's calculations boil down to merely about 100% increase of DFI for the ENTIRE 10 years. Assuming constant APY of 100%, I'd expect 100*(1,7^10) percent increase of capital. Where am I wrong?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162927)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *They DFI are frozen, take a look at the Freezer page* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162711)

    @fabioandreatta --- *It has nothing to do with a bug. The dBTC issue is a DeFiChain issue, there has be an exploit/bug on the DeFiChain Blockchain that affects locked dBTC, to protect our customers Cake haulted all dBTC deposits and withdrawals. We can only open up again, when they finish their voting and implement the soloution to it. This is probably at the end of this week.   Please note: Bitcoin BTC deposits and withdrawals work fine and there is no issue. You can always deposit and withdrawal your Bitcoin, there has never been an issue affecting it. Only dBTC is affected* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163284)
