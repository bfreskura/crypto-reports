    @Elainewindowson --- *The problem is that everyone is satisfied with low profits and most people do not invest in the long run* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/18004)

    @airy380 --- *I only check it frequently when we're close to important zones.  Otherwise it's once or twice a day.  Additionally, I only check crypto that I'm actively trading and not those that I'm staking because that's just wasting time.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/18047)
