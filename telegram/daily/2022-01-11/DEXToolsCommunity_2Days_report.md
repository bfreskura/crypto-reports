    @napascual --- *Nice, we're looking into that issue closely, we will be changing some cache policies soon to fix that* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323269)

    @napascual --- *First try hard refreshing, no need to clear site data (we don't use cookies). Its usually requested to browsers ignoring web worker updates, thus not forcing a resources refresh* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323254)

5. **dext, hold, 1k**

    @zhengshui1977 --- *I don't have to pay a monthly fee for holding 1000 dexts, does that mean? thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323438)

    @zhengshui1977 --- *What are the requirements for a standard member now? The homepage says to pay $100 in DEXT/monthly subscription, -or -1,000 DEXT/hold. It says yes in the app 1. Hold 1.000 DEXT in the wallet 2 - Transfer 278 DEXT from your current wallet to 0x469d342e4f3d9ffbedca2e2ca8ab268a6fe973c3* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323436)

    @zhengshui1977 --- *OK, thanks. This tool is pretty easy to use. If I only need to hold 1000, I am willing to buy it. I probably wouldn't consider it if it had to be paid monthly, thanks for the help* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323441)

    @AlinCZ --- *guys do i need to do something else beside holding more than 1k DEXT tokens in my wallet to get the benefits of the Standard tier?  because i have more than 1k in my wallet but i still have only 10 favorite pairs* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323316)

    @gumbercules --- *Right now you can purchase for low fees on BSC* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324070)

    @napascual --- *Our bsc backend server has been restarted for maintenance and some pairs are updating* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323802)

    @Haski1988 --- *does that work even if we are not yet listed on cmc or cg? if so, can you give me a guide?  ￼* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323814)

7. **contract, sells, doing**

    @mr_tapity_tap --- *Contract is doing 3 sells. A wallet initiated the sell. But the router or liquidity pool for rewards token is listed as maker.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323678)

    @stanes --- *Same with this one, contract is doing 4 sells.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323679)

    @stanes --- *Thanks, for so this one you can see that the contract is indeed doing 4 different sell for one tx.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323676)

    @mr_tapity_tap --- *You need to check again. I've been involved in these for a while. I know how it works.  The number of transactions is fine. (Or the contracts issue not yours 😏)  But either showing contract at least or the right seller on one of those would be a great improvement to what seems to be slightly random at the minute!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323682)

    @mr_tapity_tap --- *There are two with similar issue and similar contract* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323677)
