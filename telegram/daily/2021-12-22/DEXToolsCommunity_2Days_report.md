4. **dext, subscription, hold**

    @MonkeySuit --- *so in my opinion, dext token is a good buy/hold, I think there are big things coming for the platform, if you hold 100k you can get into the VIP group and participate in venture deals.  Other than that I would get into metaverse or p2e focused tokens early.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/315780)

    @stanes --- *You are free to have your opinion, np.  And as I said, holding 1k DEXT is enough to get the standard plan.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316168)

    @JoeyDieleman --- *Subscription (monthly payment) or hold 1000 DEXT in your wallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314930)
