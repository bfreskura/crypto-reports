2. **polytrade, world, finance**

    @piyush_gup1a --- *Polytrade is building a 100% on-chain trade financing and business finance solution specifically focused on the Metaverse.. As we progressed in developing the working capital solution for SMEs, there were 2 observations: 1. The world of trade finance is not entirely ready for decentralization - it will take a lot of time for the full transition to happen. 2. There are opportunities for similar products in the metaverse as well. With a 100% on chain solution.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356539)

    @marcromeron --- *Arul Prakash: To understand Polytrade’s business model, watch the explainer video: https://youtu.be/daBIn6yd7WU Recent developments in the last newsletter edition: https://polytrade.finance/newsletter/oct21-vol-i.pdf Our MVP was unveiled at World Blockchain Summit, Dubai on 13 Oct.

    @piyush_gup1a --- *In a 7 trillion USD trade finance industry, the unmet demand in trade finance is to the tune of $1.6 trillion. Polytrade aims to address this huge gap by harnessing the massive liquidity of the crypto world and use it to fund the working capital needs of SMEs in developing economies. We will seek funds from crypto native investors to use our platform to lend us stable coins. These stable coins are then converted to fiat or otherwise, and given to the suppliers, who then become our borrowers.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356505)

    @aruLprak --- *Polytrade obviously is building the nuts and bolts of how commerce and finance would work in the metaverse* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356549)

    @piyush_gup1a --- *Polytrade is a crypto lending platform that connects borrowers (SMEs), their buyers, lenders and other stakeholders. In a simple example, a furniture manufacturer in Vietnam, might have a outstanding invoice against, IKEA retailer in USA. IKEA needs to pay money to the manufacturer in future after 45 days. Polytrade’s whole idea is to use liquidity from the crypto markets and fund these invoices. Which means instead of waiting for IKEA to pay after 30-45 days, now the manufacturer will request for money from Polytrade. Polytrade will collect that money from IKEA after 45 days. The discount or variance in these 2 amounts, is the margin that Polytrade will make.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356506)

    @aruLprak --- *Through Polytrade,our investors and lenders will get exposure to insurance backed conventional real world asset i.e. the unpaid invoices, which is protected from the volatility of the crypto markets. These assets are protected under credit insurance.  So ability to invest in a real world asset class instrument via crypto, itself offers immense value.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356515)

9. **integration, partnered, ecosystem**

    @Crypt0sCryptic --- *they were "partnered with you guys"* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356848)

    @Crypt0sCryptic --- *are you guys partnered with megla doge gaming crypto?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356842)

    @Linkederic --- *It sounds like they're using Chainlink VRF, but Chainlink typically calls these integrations and not partnerships, because its more reflective of the nature of the relationship.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356851)

    @Sylvarantt --- *“Partnership” is an overused word in crypto.  Current integrations are announced through Twitter and later listed on Chainlink Ecosystem.  The nature of the integration will be included in the official announcement you can find through the above links.  If an integration has not been announced there are two possibilities: * A project is using Chainlink on it’s own accord since Chainlink is an open source project that anyone can use. * An announcement is forthcoming acknowledging the integration.  Please be aware that an announcement of an integration is not an endorsement of another project and that you should perform due diligence.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356846)

    @juankaramoy --- *From past integrations with blockchain ecosystem, we’ve always seen a rise in DeFi in that specific ecosystem once chainlink is integrated.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356440)

    @Kryptoheini --- *Hello i have a question. There is a new coin called Megladoge and they say they have a partnership with chainlink. Can someone from the Team confirm that ? This is no shill so pls don't kick me.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356471)

    @Tybranha --- *mentioned alongside iexec and Origintrail: https://ontochain.ngi.eu/content/dkg* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356605)

    @dejlin --- *In the not-so-distant future, you can expect CEX listing, new major partnership announcements and integrating Spaces into metaverse.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356791)

    @piyush_gup1a --- *We will keep expanding our Partnerships network to tap into newer communities. We are working on more staking programs and also geography focussed exchange listings to penetrate and access newer markets. We are going to be listed on an Indian exchange sooner to tap into the Indian market.  Very soon we will be launching our integrated roadmap which is renewed with our Metaverse product as well.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356557)

    @aruLprak --- *Its the same way, VR is here, commerce is here, Web 3.0 elements are here… they will all merge over the next 5-8 years to make a metaverse for sure* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356548)

    @aruLprak --- *Our guesstimate is that it is already here…  people have started to use it and we are starting to see bits and pieces of what would make metaverse whole.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356545)

    @marcromeron --- *When do you think Metaverse will be adopted massively?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356544)
