6. **telegram, community, support**

    @DmgBautista --- *All conversation is always held on this official chat. As per community rules, no mod will ever DM you, its against the same to DM other users and there is no official support in Telegram. Any support must always be directed to Cake by the official channels (website support for example). We do this to ensure no user gets victim of a scam, therefore, anyone getting DM, even from someone who may look a mod, will surelly be a scammer. Just block and report. If for any reason a user may need to speak directly to a mod or other user, can place such request directly in here in the community chat. After a positive feedback, can send a message. A mod will never start that conversation even when asked if can be contacted directly here, the user must establish first contact. And always here, to ensure that does not asks someone trying to impersonate a mod.   But all this can be easily avoided. Just check the community channel rules (valid for any community chat), read them thoroughly and follow them religiously. If you got a DM, just block and report, DM must be treated as a scamm attempt. Even if it looks someone exactly good looking as me 😂😂😂 No security is enough when speaking about your funds!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/155762)

    @DmgBautista --- *Thats strange, if its not the first time you have made a deposit and already had an ERC-20 address, that should not happen.
