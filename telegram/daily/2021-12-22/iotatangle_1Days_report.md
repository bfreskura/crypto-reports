    @Basti --- *1. Iota network is working. It's on binance that they don't allow withdrawals. 2.

Sell and rebuy on a different exchange* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/300547)

6. **firefly, address, iota**

    @Raw --- *Hello, maybe someone can help me, with the Firefly SHA256 check I get a different number than with the Firefly Release Notes, it starts with 1d and not with 4c.  Does anyone have any idea why that could be?  Or does anyone know a good Iota Telegram group?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/300984)

    @allavenand --- *So how do I get a Firefly Iota address? And not a atoi address….* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301052)

    @allavenand --- *Hello everybody, what am I missing, I moved my iota tokens to Bitfinex and now I would like to transfer them to the new firefly account I created, however when I try to send my iota tokens the address I get is a Mi and it’s says that it is an invalid address. I guess I am missing something… thank you very much for your help* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301020)

    @allavenand --- *I just noticed a strange thing, my Firefly address starts by atoi and not iota, could this be the reason* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301048)

    @Markus --- *You don't have To send iota anywhere. In firefly-wallet the only thing I had To do was To update firefly and  click the stake button. If you have To send somewhere you are being scammed.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/300942)

    @allavenand --- *Yep I downloaded the firefly app, opened a new wallet and when I go to deposit iota   from Bitfinex it gives me an error saying that the address is not correct* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301035)

    @Sailor --- *It's simply to creat new firefly wallet using your seeds* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301095)

    @Toby --- *Okay usually pin code makes life easier than remembering a complex password. How can one reset password then* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/300869)
