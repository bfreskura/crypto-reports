1. **rewards, days, claim**

    @florin22xxl --- *thank you! Last question, under contract expiration it says 1 year, can i stop staking after 90 days? Or i can only stop after 1 year* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232444)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *There is no autocompound, if you want to reinvest you need to click reinvest in staking pools  Approve and deposit in Farming pools* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232443)

    @Life_is_love_La_la_la_la_la --- *Admins: I'm sorry to ask a question about DYP staking (V2) which must have been answered a thousand times but I will temper it by first saying that I have staked 665 DYP in the 90 day contract today and from what I have seen tick-up in claimable DYP rewards it appears to be incredibly "rewarding" simply on the basis of what I have been awarded today. I think i  remember reading that the the rewards are auto-compounding but I cannot see the mechanism by which this happens. From what I see on screen I can click on "Reinvest" whenever I wish but this is a manual process. Am I misunderstanding something? The other thing is would beg your patience to explain is how are the DYP rewards calculated/derived? Are they derived from a proportion of fees generated within the platform or do some of the Avalanche fees feed back into the reward pot? I hope this is not too tiresome a question and that others may benefit from your clarification of the position. Many thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232513)

    @uBrown --- *I didn't get my reward Today* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231933)

    @Cricascar --- *Yes ,that is what I'm saying if you don't claim at the same hour you lose rewards right* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232404)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Hello it is perfectly ok to ask questions no issues but please use paragraphs 😅  Coming to the first answer the rewards are NOT auto compounded and no where mentioned by us that there is auto compounding , may be you misread it. Yes if you want to add more you can use reinvest and this doesn't reset timer.  Second question: The staking works under POS(Proof of stake concept) there are many explanation regarding this already available on Google and Youtube so please check out them* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232514)

    @timdyp --- *This is available for all the persons that are asking ''when is the new exchange coming''. We have provided all the required information from their compliance department on 8th of December, there is nothing else that we can do at this time. Also, because of the NDA we are not allowed to share any information. When the time comes, it will be announced by both the exchange and our team.  Plus, we have applied for a secondary tier 1 exchange, and we have received positive feedback from their team. But again, same story, we need to wait for the next step.  Basically there is nothing that we can do from our side, we just need to wait.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232488)

    @Bekirr1 --- *Do I have a permanent loss to the body while ascending? Doesn't my money have to go up when I go up?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232367)

    @Bekirr1 --- *Good Morning. Why is my farm not increasing while dyp is increasing?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232359)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *I do understand, just please go check and compare the marketprices at the time of deposit and now, so that you can understand why the reason for the decrease in your value, the value increases when these tokens raises too this is what we call impermanent loss and this is common risk involved in yield farming.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232366)

    @Bekirr1 --- *I don't shoot anyway so that there is no permanent loss. My question is why is my investment not going up when the market is going up? You always give the same fudge answers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232363)

6. **wbnb, wbnb idyp, pair**

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Hey the farm LP involved iDYP and WBNB pair* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232360)

    @RadiantPhoenix4 --- *That means 75 CAKE will be used to provide liquidity and I'll receive LP tokens.  This is my main question:  At the end of the contract, if $CAKE is now worth $20 per token, but the WBNB/iDYP pair has suffered a dip, will I receive less than 75CAKE?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232143)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Yes because your CAKE is converted to WBNB-iDYP pair so your value depends on marketprice of these token at the time of your withdrawal* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232147)

    @ShrutiShruti99 --- *Whats the current price of wbnb?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232325)

    @RadiantPhoenix4 --- *So, depending on the price of CAKE and WBNB/iDYP pair, I could receive more than 75CAKE or less than 75CAKE.  understood* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232150)

    @RadiantPhoenix4 --- *Also, if the WBNB/iDYP pair has a price rise, will I receive more than 75CAKE at the end of the contract?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232145)
