Without interoperability cryptocurrency is doomed to fail'  Do you have an opinion to it? I appreciate it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/458168)

7. **chains, blockchain, security**

    @OS4UU --- *Hi all, can someone clarify me why it is Cosmos a good way of interconecting blockchains? I don't really understand the goal or the product apart from Cosmos own blockchain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457074)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *💥INTERCHAIN SECURITY COMING TO COSMOS HUB! 💥   🟪Interchain Security will allow Cosmos chains to lease security to each other. What this means, in practice, is that validators on one chain (the security provider) will be able to validate on another (the security consumer).  Earning Rewards On Many Chains  🟪Interchain Security will allow ATOM holders to earn staking rewards on a large number of Cosmos chains, just by staking their ATOMs. Consumer chains will benefit both from robust security from the Cosmos Hub validator set, and by getting their tokens in the hands of the Cosmos community of early adopters.  📄 For More Details Read This Blog Post* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457432)

    @OS4UU --- *Why are there bsc and erc20 contracts of Cosmos if Cosmos hat his own Blockchain?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457634)

    @AtomJazz --- *Those are just wrapped token solutions from those projects. Not related with Cosmos at all. We don't suggest using it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457637)

    @OS4UU --- *Not related with Cosmos at all? These Contracts Adresses are shown on Cosmos Profile from CMC. I think understand you @WorkerBee_3 thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457639)

    @AtomJazz --- *Hey there! Interoperability allows horizontal scalability. Instead of trying to run many dAPPs on one single chain, Cosmos allows to run infinite numbers of application specific blockchains. In Cosmos we have specialized AMM chains, smart contract chains, defi chains, privacy chains, gaming chains all able to intercommunicate and exchange data.  https://mapofzones.com/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/458169)
