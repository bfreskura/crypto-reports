5. **chivo, salvador, el salvador**

    @S --- *Can someone from the foundation set the record straight on this please? I can’t find any official sources that say Chivo runs on Algorand. Just a couple opinion pieces that don’t cite real evidence. The koibanx deal with El Salvador doesn’t mention Chivo from what I can see. There are no mainnet transactions that indicate Chivo is running on Algorand…if this is just a viral rumor, the foundation should clear things up sooner rather than later to stop the spread of misinformation.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324487)

    @Cook --- *And it’s not just the chivo app. El Salvador is building their entire blockchain infrastructure using Algorand as rails* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324471)

    @Sanchayan_bhunia --- *What is it called, yeah! the chivo wallet uses Algorand technology* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324469)

    @Chocoim --- *Nevwe dare to compare algo to eth and btc Algo is chain with billions of coins created out of thin air and slow development controlled by few people at top . Btc and eth having thousands of running on it.. r decentralied chain... had to put lof of effort and energy to create them...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324670)

Yeah, nice thinking.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324700)

    @Tiny_Philosopher_784 --- *You wanted to dance, you should dance. You can't tiptoe back and forth across the line of support and attack. If you despise algorand, that much, it's simple: sell* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324697)

    @Tiny_Philosopher_784 --- *Have you even used algorand? You sound like a troll from another group* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324650)
