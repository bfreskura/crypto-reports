Please remember Binance is a centralized exchange, so when you request a withdrawal from Binance to  wallet, the Binance side will need to approve it, and the tx will NOT be recorded in the blockchain until Binance approved it. You may contact Binance tech support for more assistance ❤ Thank you so much!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/875735)
