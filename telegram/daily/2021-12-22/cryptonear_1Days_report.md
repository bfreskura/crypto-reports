2. **aurora, bridge, eth**

    @NEARverse_xd --- *Aurora is an evm built on the NEAR and it is allowing devs to operate their apps on an eth compatible and scalable platform. So we don't need to rewrite applications from the scratch as aurora is fully compatible with eth. Also, aurora bridge is a part of the NEAR Rainbow Bridge which is the fully trustless bridge allowing transfer of eth and erc20 tokens between eth, aurora and near with low transaction fee.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/246973)

    @larry_lang --- *yeah i think stNEAR bridging is possible- but just a head up stNEAR is not yet tradeable on Aurora network so it's best keeping it here* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/246777)
