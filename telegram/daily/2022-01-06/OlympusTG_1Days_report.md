    @Realcrypto123 --- *Hi Team, have 2 questions: 1) Why price of v2 is lower than v1? 2) Which price I should look at in case I own gOHM before the transition? (I wrapped my sOHM onto gOHM 1 month ago, before the transition). To rephrase my question, I would like to know what will be my sOHM rewards based on after I unwrap some day.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/142349)

4. **borrow, collateral, rari**

    @nfwaple --- *no just one place, it means that rari is offering 0% because you only get what you're supposed to get from Olympus. If you deposit 1 gOHM to rari, you should still have 1 gOHM one month later* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/142569)

    @nfwaple --- *this one is cool ^, using gOHM as collateral to borrow at 0% interest* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/142604)

    @nfwaple --- *no, your gOHM is always in staked form so it earns rewards anywhere* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143155)

    @diobosco1 --- *Am I right that in the end its no difference for a staker whether he stakes in sOHM or gOHM? Thanks for your help.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/142540)

    @nfwaple --- *no, gOHM is already staked, you're just going to the website to visualise your holding, you should be able to see something under Staked Balance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143104)

    @nfwaple --- *nothing you need to do, gOHM is staked and earning rewards, no further action required* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/142437)

    @nfwaple --- *you have to change your wallet network to ETH mainnet first, Stake page only exists on ETH mainnet because other chains don't need to stake as they will only have gOHM, gOHM is already staked so no need to have a stake page* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143099)
