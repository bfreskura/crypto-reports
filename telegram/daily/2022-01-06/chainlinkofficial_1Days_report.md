3. **vector, field, vector field**

    @joey_roth --- *So Vector Field is my way of exploring this materiality that blockchain affords. It’s the foundation of the dynamic (changing after mint based on real-time data feeds) on-chain art that I’m working on now* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360666)

    @rheeunion --- *Hi, Josh. I'm reading chainlink Docs right now, and I have few questions regarding VRF.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360287)

    @Joypokkamol --- *In just a few moments, we will have a Community Q&A with Vector Field who recently announced that it integrates Chainlink VRF to Deliver Secure Randomness for On-Chain Materiality in NFTs. https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1478410899727785993?s=20* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360643)

    @Joypokkamol --- *It is fascinating to see Vector Field Integrates Chainlink VRF.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360668)

    @joey_roth --- *My background is industrial design and hardware as I mentioned before, so this generating forms using true randomness (from VRF) and then encoding them immutably and directly onto the ethereum blockchain is as close as digital art can get to physical art* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360662)

    @joey_roth --- *It does three main things - requests a random number from VRF, uses that number to generate svg code with boundaries for dimensions, opacity, and colors that I set, and then encodes the svg to bytes32 as the token uri* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360660)

4. **grants, grant, community grants**

    @harrumphharrumph --- *Any project can request a grant and will be reviewed. Take a look through https://chain.link/community/grants for categories and past recipients to understand what qualifies.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359891)

    @Angelikov --- *Hello, Thanks a lot. I have reviewed but cannot find the terms and conditions and Of all the grants, the closest to our project is community grants. But, there is not much information. Do you have an information format?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359894)

    @Angelikov --- *Hello thank you very much. Yes, we want Participation in community grants but we do not see on the page The specific milestones you mention we only see the form* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359909)

    @JoshSimenhoff --- *Hey Angelica, thanks for asking here. The terms and conditions vary depending on the grant and are decided during the application process. Each grant has specific milestones that need to be reached in order for the grantee to receive the grant. Does this answer your question? Have you already applied for a grant? If not DM me and I can help you decide if Chainlink Community grants can provide support for your team or project.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359904)

    @JoshSimenhoff --- *Thank you for the offer sir but we are not currently hiring moderators.

    @jh3318 --- *So I have a question. I’d like to get more involved with the project is there anything I can do? Been researching running a node. I heard staking is eventually coming not sure if it’s true or not. Either way I’m looking for suggestions to get steered in the right direction. Any help or advice is appreciated. Tyia* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360140)

    @Kokenyesi --- *Hi guys, any dates about staking announced? More than a year is gone & I still hear ‘soon’, but atleast now Sergey called it it will be in 2022 Do we have atleast which quarters now? 2022 Q3? Q4? Maybe late Q2? If staking would come in next months we would been able to see more data on githube in the staking documents, so I guess it will come probably around june or july if no delays? I am fine with that, atleast we securly know it comes in 2022* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360736)

    @marcromeron --- *Chainlink staking is not yet available. Other forms of staking offered by exchanges are actually yield farming, lending/borrowing, which is not endorsed by us and is outside the scope of discussion in this channel.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360335)

    @Jamie --- *Nice do you have any idea what the staking rate will be* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360200)
