    @error_500 --- *Hello, can someone from the DYP team explain why the 'To be burnt/disbursed' value shows 0.000 for the BSC farm for 90 days, there weren’t any GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS, from the last proposal that was executed a month ago, and even then it was skipped on the BSC 90 days farm? The last time I check there was more than ~100,000  'To be burnt/disbursed' !!!

8. **claim, fees, max fees**

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *This is from Metamask estimation and as said this is Max fees that will be charged and that is based on ETH network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237425)

    @Craig --- *This is the estimated fee to claim 386 DYP. If I click on 'claim' WETH, the estimated fee is $35. It makes no sense.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237428)

    @Craig --- *It shows the same GWEI amount for both claims, but the dollar amount is 10x higher. It makes no sense.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237419)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *The metamask shows Max fees the actual charge will be less, I see that ETH nework is congested the GWEI is ranging upto 200 so this might be reason* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237418)

    @Craig --- *Why is it to claim DYP rewards the amount of fees are 10x what it is to claim your underlying asset? So, if to claim WETH costs $50, to claim DYP costs $500.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237416)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Try completing the transaction the actual cost will be less of what is shown the Metamask estimates max fees* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237420)
