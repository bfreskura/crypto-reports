(Now that the necessary legos are available.)  https://twitter.com/brypto_/status/1478569378727796738?s=21  Could be that 2022 finally sees a 2nd core base yield injected into the circle of life next to Curve?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312950)

    @SpikeSpiege1 --- *If the token is transferable then it should be tradeable though. So should be market for both. Article says locked positions work as nfts* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/313242)

    @PmRiviere --- *SOON https://twitter.com/thekeep3r/status/1478643116148207618  Although i m not sure which assets will have liquidity when it starts* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312929)

    @Joel_john --- *sure, please do - you should also check the amount of innovation powerpool has done this last year on auto-rebalancing assets,* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/313109)

2. **gas, gwei, tx**

    @ivangbi --- *Is the gas is not used, it will just be given back. If the gas is not enough, even if has more gwei, it is then failed. The one with more gwei wins all things neutral?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312810)

    @andrecronje --- *I notice you didn't mention FTM... tsk tsk* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312944)

3. **porn, currency, mozilla**

    @svenblockchain --- *"The cryptocurrency industry, whose business model would seem unrealistic and ham-handed if it was a villain on Captain Planet: they manufacture only POLLUTION, nothing else, and they turn that into money.  They call it a "currency" but the only thing you can do with it is pay ransom after your computer was hacked! You can't even use it to buy porn!  And make no mistake, if you can't use a thing to buy porn, that thing is not a currency."* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312907)

    @phil_muhbags --- *>cryptocurrencies are not currencies >Websites are allowing users to pay via crypto   Well...Which one is it?

    @Swader --- *This bothers him but not Mozilla's profiteering off the free labor of 2.5th world countries, or their pretense of a non profit while shoving ads down your throat in q browser that takes half a minute to load. People are strange.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312903)

    @syed_jafri --- *Don’t worry, that’s what they call crypto anyways* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/313093)

    @sashatsereteli --- *And people and organizations who absolutely should know better -- The Long Now Foundation, The Internet Archive (keep fucking that potato), Mozilla, and so many others -- are still adding cryptocurrencies to their checkout options like it's not a god damned planet killer.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312909)

    @olliten --- *Ok so what is the protocol? What value does it provide?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/313194)

    @phil_muhbags --- *Also what is with this potato game I keep hearing about. Is like every action recorded? I thought most games, except very simple ones, don't run on chain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/313059)

    @yic_alex --- *Is there a bridge that allows me to bridge FTM from Ethereum to Fantom? The anyswap router has no liquidity on the Fantom side, apparently.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312920)

    @ivangbi --- *This basically fixes that step, and makes it into one protocol?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/313133)
