    @MaveJ --- *Really 60m? That would be indeed an improvement. Interesting why mine is pending and not progressed. As mentioned, cake becomes more and more an exchange in view of the dToken at least practically. Will wait the mentioned 72h …* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/161036)

    @MaveJ --- *Would be really great if cake could reduce the time of withdrawals, in particular for higher amounts.
