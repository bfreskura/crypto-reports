1. **fake, dao, official**

    @DG --- *We're down 10b in staked TRX from ath. Should we be concerned it's less secure? Also, entire TRX supply is now in circulation. If TRON is truly decentralized, why can't we propose and collectively reduce total supply by removing TRON Foundation TRX?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3811853)

    @PiterSpain --- *📢 Led by the founder, supported by developers & super representatives, #TRON established itself as one of the top public chains and eventually transformed itself into a fully decentralized and self-governed organization and gave birth to TRON DAO.🙌 https://trondao.medium.com/announcement-on-tron-foundation-restructured-as-tron-dao-3b18aec7699e   ⚒️ At present, the total number of #TRON accounts has exceeded 70 million. #TRON is showered with a myriad of decentralized projects in #stablecoins, wallets, storage, exchanges, lending, liquidity mining, cross-chain applications, Oracle, social media, games, etc.   🚀 #TRON Foundation has settled to dissolve itself on July 25, 2021, which fits better into the next development stage of TRON. TRON DAO is tipped to leverage the TRON protocol to decentralize the Internet while boosting effective governance for community members.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3810738)
