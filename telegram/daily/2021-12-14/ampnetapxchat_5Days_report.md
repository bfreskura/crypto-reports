    @mislavjavor --- *@pin_doll we have said we don't refund funds accidentaly sent to the deployer... We are willing to make an exception for you and a couple of others, but it's very low on the priority list for us. Your message was deleted because you accused us of stealing.   We have received over 1000 ETH in value during the fundraise, there is really no motive to steal 1 ETH from you or 300 USDC from some other person or 1000 USDT from a third person. The fact is, you sent the funds to the wrong address - it's our good will to refund them.   Which we will do, when we get to it - and no sooner.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35637)
