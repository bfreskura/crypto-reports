    @NotTheGodfather --- *well you are welcome to opinions, but I was told about the virus before it released in 2019, and I've been shown how the new economy will look and some of the entities that are driving it so I'm pretty confident. It's the same investment model our group has used since 2018 and we've done fairly well.

    @NotTheGodfather --- *there's dozens of alts that come up when you do ERD mapping of establishment projects. But one that I'm watching right now is Cudos. Cloud computing project that will power many of the metaverse and NFT projects, which seems wiser than trying to pick the winners in those sectors. Some very interesting connections to the London finance hub, and partnerships with AMD and Hydro66. Mainnet coming up in January. Truth is you can spot NWO tech everywhere tho. They practically glow lol* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/707667)
