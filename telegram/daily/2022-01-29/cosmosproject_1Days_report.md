1. **cosmos, support, validator**

    @ZoltanAtom --- *💥INTERCHAIN SECURITY COMING TO COSMOS HUB! 💥   🟪Interchain Security will allow Cosmos chains to lease security to each other. What this means, in practice, is that validators on one chain (the security provider) will be able to validate on another (the security consumer).  Earning Rewards On Many Chains  🟪Interchain Security will allow ATOM holders to earn staking rewards on a large number of Cosmos chains, just by staking their ATOMs. Consumer chains will benefit both from robust security from the Cosmos Hub validator set, and by getting their tokens in the hands of the Cosmos community of early adopters.  📄 For More Details Read This Blog Post* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/482259)
