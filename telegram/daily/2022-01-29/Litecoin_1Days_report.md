1. **ln, channel, chain**

    @SBH --- *How about putting documents on the blockchain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054065)

    @kevinvik --- *Thank you, I didn't know.  I guess I will use both ways the next time* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2053975)

    @Wateriswater --- *But doesn't LN basically hide it anyways* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054543)

    @Wateriswater --- *Is it needed to actually transfer between channels though* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054564)

    @SBH --- *not the picture, but the keys, to proof ownership to it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054093)

    @Wateriswater --- *So if it hides amounts it really only can obscure how much collateral is in the channel* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054557)

2. **litecoin, doge, community**

    @YuumuraKirika --- *The problem with doge is that trying to pump it is like trying to count all of the grains of sand in a desert. It has infinite supply and is highly inflationary... It dilutes it's own value at such a fast rate that it's a botomless pit of value depreciation* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054513)

    @finitemaz --- *No, Litecoin doesnt "need" better marketing.  The ones who think it does need to learn what separates the litecoin network from 'new coins from vietnam that mastered community engagement'* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054644)

    @RorschachTesst --- *Doge literally started out as a meme coin but has more word of mouth than ltc and is being accepted by tesla. Shiba is being accepted by amc. So yeah, I wouldn't resort to whataboutism..a useless coin can eventually demonstrate utility. Rather let's talk about why ltc has a defect in its price and what can be done to overcome it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054715)

    @ForDaTek --- *Litecoin holders should start shilling Litecoin to Billionaires on their social media. Dogecoin holders are so active and here we have people just complain all day. LTC buyers are just the most low energy people ever and don’t do anything whilst dogecoin holders actually get together and even spend the dogecoin for sponsorships etc to get recognised, what do litecoin holders do here?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054474)

    @professional --- *Maybe better for you leave Litecoin community and join to doge community* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054485)

    @Notbiden --- *Fuk doge should have been demerge mined that coin is biggest joke and Elon played them fools* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054501)

3. **price, virtual, group**

    @ForDaTek --- *I don’t understand why people stop buying at low prices but fomo in at high prices?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054044)

    @bake_Crypto --- *it just has changed and mass adoption means tech or decentralization or "idologi" against banks is not important. imo.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054719)

    @RabbitL0v3r --- *I think the price action isn't related to this telegram group Even when the whole group is bullish and no one is fudin, it doesn't stop the price retracement* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054612)

    @Macro5674 --- *More the people accepts metaverse and virtual businesses more the government gets stand to lockdowns ! First Idiocracy and now Matrix is now becoming a documentary 😂 where actually rather than to extract energy from us , they creating a metaverse world to decrease the energy to control us to a limited spaces with no ownership on real world !* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054108)

    @RorschachTesst --- *How cute that you think this group is going to control the price of a coin with millions in circulating supply.  Secondly, if you guys think the coin doesn't need any marketing and the tech will do the talk then stop worrying about fud.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054698)

    @arnego2 --- *Its stupid to blame crypto for laundering issuies. Wirh argument you need  to prohibit $ and the €.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054463)

4. **mweb, january, end**

    @coblee --- *MWEB will definitely change the game. What affect that will have on price is anyone’s guess though.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054406)

    @T bird --- *So no MWEB in January? How many times will we be lied to?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054744)

    @dilc11 --- *The release will be in January, but the activation will take several months, most likely they will activate at the end of March* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054747)

    @RorschachTesst --- *Let's see how the rest of the market reacts when mweb is out(no idea when that's happening anymore, it keeps getting pushed forever)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054694)

5. **ltc, change, short**

    @onecryptochick --- *is LTC going to get into the DeFi space* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054004)

    @finitemaz --- *we'll work on something for new people to be exposed to actual news and links to address most of the misinterpretations people seem to have regarding ltc. I mean we have people still creating FUD about Charlie selling, and some complaining about marketing because they compare LTC to centralized scams with funding from a premine.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054619)

    @Musashi_Kansai --- *With all due respect you are simply wrong. The balance as it exists scares away those not attempting to fud for profit. We know this because there have been a couple moments in the past where due to proper enforcement real LTC supporters emerged from the shadows.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054570)

    @onecryptochick --- *Please do not post in the LTC Telegram group if you can't do high level mathematics (3rd grade+).  Lets keep this group high quality.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054361)

    @Kglugenbeel --- *LTC was my very first Crypto; think it’s time for a #ComeBackStory ❤️* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054214)

    @RorschachTesst --- *Further reinforcing the fact that ltc is a scam? We need big players to talk, not random tweets talking about their coin. It will come off as another shitclon project promoting itself* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054735)

6. **fud, ones, fudding**

    @Musashi_Kansai --- *We have people who show up like it’s their job to fud.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054583)

    @ForDaTek --- *We just sit here and complain all day.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054510)

    @JohnTheApostle --- *Or simply uneducated on the issue* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054466)

    @finitemaz --- *I think he meant many voices choose to not participate at all because of relentless FUD they are exposed to initially.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054606)

    @Musashi_Kansai --- *We all want what’s best for the community and many voices are being silenced. Thanks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054577)

    @RabbitL0v3r --- *So your solution is to silence more voice? Interesstin reasoning* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054591)
