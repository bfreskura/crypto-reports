    @ZoltanAtom --- *If someone DM to you, block ad report them immediately! No wallet support on telegram. ⚠️⚠️⚠️* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/462846)

    @vladc1 --- *If you are a member of any crypto-related #Telegram or #WhatsApp group, you are a target for all sorts of scammers  There are 3 main kinds of scams in #crypto communities: fake groups, copycat admins, and pump and dump groups  1. The perpetrators create a copycat group that mimics an original. For example, it might offer an opportunity to purchase tokens at a discount price  Change your group invite settings to "My contacts" only — and you’ll essentially eliminate this problem  2. After requesting support in a public group you can receive a DM from the copycat admin. They will pretend to help you, but end up asking for your #privatekeys or #seedphrase  Search the group for posts from this user — if nothing appears, it's a fake admin  3. The feigned purpose of most pump groups is to provide insider insights  Many of these platforms will try to promote a sense of urgency in you, to force you to act without thinking. If you get this feeling, you’re probably dealing with a pump group  Please take care!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/462116)
