1. **time, wonderland, gas**

    @FutureTiger --- *I was just about to send some JOE from my gateIO, or some AVAX from my Binance, to my Metamask, in order to convert into AVAX/MEMO/TIME on Wonderland, but then I noticed that on app . wonderland . money I cannot connect to Metamask , nor to wallet . avax . network , so this is all starting to look dreadfully complicated .. any SIMPLE way to get started on Wonderland?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318465)

    @FutureTiger --- *Ah yes, Daniele, he was recommended on Banter, by Ran I think, or maybe Ellio Trades... probably both, and many more :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318522)

    @bobby_blanco --- *Time has a solid core of devs who are all very well known like Daniele sestagalli .. time is part of an ecosystem that includes popsicle finance , abracadabra and he is taking over sushi swap .. they already have plenty of money and the likely hood of them destroying there reputation by rug pulling is highly unlikely .. the apy fluctuation and price are offset by the compounding interest you get on your account 3 times a day..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318512)

    @FutureTiger --- *i am very wary of the hi-APY platforms cos there are YT vids of people making NO money due to plummeting APY or other causes.. I am more confident about Wonderland because I saw Ian Balina deployed on it on 3rd DEC :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318508)
