    @sinaht --- *I can change it back to wavax or avax using pangolin?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235124)

    @Onur --- *23.34 LP how much avax is it worth* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235456)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *LP is WAVAX-iDYP pair, when you deposited smart contract does 75% to LP on which you earn wavax and 25% to dyp on which you earn DYP* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235119)

    @sinaht --- *Sorry for too much Q but what is lp? It’s my wavax?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235116)

    @Wheadonator --- *Okay thanks I've read it but I don't think it answers my question unfortunately. For instance this says 75% of my WAVAX goes to AVAX/DYP pool on Pangolin (Pangolin states fee's of up to 0.25% per transaction on the LP) so I don't see how this ends up with the high APR* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235326)

5. **fee, deposit, gas**

    @shinigamikami --- *Cause of the current gwei 130 staking gas fee would be $100+ you can wait for it to come down below 100 gwei, anytime it’s below 100 gwei it won’t charge you more than $100 regardless of the suggested gas* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235070)

    @shinigamikami --- *Leme check the current gwei and give you max estimate it will charge* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235066)

    @sinaht --- *I deposited a couple of days ago but in earned section it still says zero!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235109)

    @appliepietrade --- *hi admin,  i am still confused by the statement on the staking site that says "Please approve before staking. 0% fee for deposit." while I clicking deposit, it will charge 3 hundred something for the deposit( the gas fee might be lower that what it says for the gas fee), but why you provide this 0 percent fee for deposit?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235356)

    @iamJubi --- *Hello. DYP team or the pool don’t charge fee upon deposit. What charges fee is Eth/bsc/avalanche chain.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235358)

    @sinaht --- *And as you said the later the better right fee wise I mean* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235114)

All Cats are dope, but some are more outstanding than others depending on the watch they wear.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235480)

7. **apy, dynamic, apy dynamic**

    @Vl_investor --- *Why does APY STAKE AVAX go down so much by itself?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234966)

    @hemanrock --- *APY is dynamic. When more users deposit, it can be decreased.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234967)

    @hemanrock --- *APY is dynamic and it can be increased or decreased.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234960)

    @DJ Olkan --- *Hi. Newbie here. Looking to stake DYP (ETH chain), 90-day locked, currently at 496% APY. Once in, is the APY also locked for that time period or sliding? Thanks for your help* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234958)

    @hemanrock --- *Hey our devs used some good strategies to have good APY's and passive income, also it is common scenario to have this high APY's if pools are fresh but still the APY's will be good enough moving forward. The APY is dynamic it can increased or decreased.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235328)

    @Wheadonator --- *hi, any good info on how APY's are so high, i see that tokens are split between AVAX/DYP LP and LP staking but I can't figure out how this alone ends up in 000's of returns* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235312)
