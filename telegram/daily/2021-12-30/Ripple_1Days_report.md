1. **xrp, ripple, case**

    @JustinTKFoo --- *Since the SEC case against Ripple is expected to go in favor of Ripple, is it a good time to ape on XRP?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3032925)

    @Likeitorpumpit --- *XRP be higher than we all think !!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3032498)

    @XRPslayer --- *Everyone should just relax. Xrp has a very good position in this crypto market and actually solves problems that we have been battling for years. In my opinion, ripple will blow this case off the face of the earth. Ive been following the lawsuit every single day since it started and if you go and look at all the facts then you will be able to make a decision. When i invested my first bit of money in XRP i told myself that it will be as a 5year investment so im not worried about what it does now while this lawsuit is still happening. Just forget about the price now and relax and forget about the idea that you will become rich overnight. All good things take time, dont rush the market. Let it take its course and practice holding those coins.     Diamond hands!!!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3032420)

    @A.A. --- *I’m wondering about crypto market and how its move. Brent and crude oil keep raising up. US market reached new historical top and they have seen Santa clause rally. Crypto market is still suffering from what? It’s all about luck and I can’t bid on my own luck, it is going from bottom to deep bottom. Cross fingers to get best of luck for us* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3032365)

    @A.A. --- *Focus on BTC, it is the main benchmark for all coins. I see most of other coins are ready to hit back their previous prices but unfortunately BTC pressures the market down.

    @NialPial --- *So if you ask me, there is definitely some clarity in terms of the lawsuit, it just wont be published yet, since it’ll impact too many economic standards.
