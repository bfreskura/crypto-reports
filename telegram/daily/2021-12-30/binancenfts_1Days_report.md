9. **dark, game, darkfrontiers**

    @irfanecruz --- *What is the reason why does Dark Frontiers have 2 tokens $GAME and $DARK? Does these tokens are listed on exchanges? #DarkFrontiers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419918)

    @nuryildiz58 --- *"Sometimes" phrase took interesting when you mention about "Dark Matter Energy, in combination with $GAME Tokens and sometimes combined with $DARK Tokens"   In what cases there would occur a combination? #DarkFrontiers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419897)

    @sylviasavi --- *$DARK token will serve as an in-game energy unit. Energy is needed to power the gameplay - travel, mine and merge NFTs. It can also be mined by claiming land on different planets. So $DARK will be very much like the heart and the blood of the game.  $GAME will also be featured, it will act as a booster to certain in-game processes, and you will also be able to buy NFTs with $GAME on Gamestarter marketplace.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419815)

    @sylviasavi --- *First of all, $DARK is a BEP-20 token, as we believe it's the most friendly infrastructure for games at the moment. $GAME also has a BEP-20 bridge.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419814)

    @Kenikky --- *Can you tell us about $DARK and $GAME and how they are used in the platform?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419813)
