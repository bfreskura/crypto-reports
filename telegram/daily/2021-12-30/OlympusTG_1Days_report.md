3. **stake, staked, gohm**

    @nfwaple --- *gOHM does not need to be staked, it is always in staked form. Second pic: https://twitter.com/dopex_intern/status/1473439395999068162/photo/1* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/136883)

    @dropkickdarren --- *gOHM vs. sOHM TL;DR: gOHM is more useful than sOHM. gOHM is available across many networks/blockchains, avoids staking/unstaking fees, and will be supported by other DeFi projects. It's the preferred way to hold staked OHM. sOHM can be used Olympus Give or just holding. No other uses. Both tokens get exactly the same rewards.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/136848)

    @willyc --- *When we switch to gohm is it already staked then or..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/137542)

    @BTC - TheDaddy - TheFuture --- *buy gOHM on uniswap that way there is no approve cost and no stake costs and everything shows up on the dashboard. you may have to add the gOHM token address to uniswap which you can obtain from coingecko* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/137952)

    @d --- *If gohm is already staked does it just automatically compound in my wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/137898)

    @Ap0l1o --- *you don't have to stake gOhm Fren* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/137370)

4. **migrate, migration, rebases**

    @cryptojai --- *I speculate that a Lot of folks freaked during this migration and withdrew. That plus a general bearish sentiment. When dust settles and whales re enter we will hopefully see juicy rebound.  It could be days or months away.  Tame the emotions.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/137670)

    @nohso --- *i dont remember, but theres no button to click for migrate anymore, its gone* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/136957)

    @cdp279 --- *Well. The migration also happened just before the market started dumping. So I don’t think this is entirely the case ser. Maybe some chumps decided to get out but yeah* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/137672)
