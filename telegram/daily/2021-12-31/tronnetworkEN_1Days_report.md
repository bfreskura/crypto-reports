6. **eth, dump, trx**

    @thebigguns --- *Anybody else seen the top post on Reddit fudding Justin Sun and Tron? Basically it says JS has been dumping 165,000 ETH through Binance. What are your guys thoughts about this? In my opinion, the on-chain data doesn’t really prove anything.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3799066)
