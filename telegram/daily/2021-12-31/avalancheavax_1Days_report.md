3. **bsc, chain, bridge**

    @bobby_blanco --- *Swap the usdt.e to usdc on trader joe .. then go to the bridge .. make sure you have bsc network set up on MetaMask first.. start the bridge and swap your usdc from avax to bsc.. your usdc in your avax account on MetaMask will move over to your usdc on your bsc account on MetaMask .. then send the usdc from your bsc account on MetaMask to a bsc address* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318523)

    @bobby_blanco --- *You need to bridge avax tokens via avax bridge to bsc chain and then send it from a bsc wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318516)

    @helolleh --- *guys, can I return money if I sent usdt.e from avax network to bep20 USDT address? 🙊* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318513)

    @FutureTiger --- *Hullo chaps, when withdrawing AVAX from gateIO, I am offered 2 Chains, AVAX chain and AVAX C-Chain. The fee for AVAX chain is small but AVAX C-Chain is very expensive. Is it safe to send AVAX from Gate to Metamask using AVAX Chain? If it is not safe, perhaps I should buy TIME on gateIO itself, and then send TIME to MM using AVAX C-Chain. For some mysterious reason the fee is small when withdrawing TIME from Gate using AVAX C-Chain !* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318702)

    @Gabriel --- *hello. was wondering if there is a cheaper way to get from kucoin to c-chain then the bridge ? tu* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318609)

4. **piggy, demand, pshare**

    @bobby_blanco --- *Time has a solid core of devs who are all very well known like Daniele sestagalli .. time is part of an ecosystem that includes popsicle finance , abracadabra and he is taking over sushi swap .. they already have plenty of money and the likely hood of them destroying there reputation by rug pulling is highly unlikely .. the apy fluctuation and price are offset by the compounding interest you get on your account 3 times a day..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318512)

    @bobby_blanco --- *Is anyone here invested in time wonderland* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318446)

    @oceanboy007 --- *Piggy is an algorithmic stablecoin on Avalanche, created through a simple yet complex process of minting or burning Piggy tokens dependent on supply and demand. More demand allows the staked PSHARE (Piggy Share) token to mint more PIGGY to meet demand. Less demand means more selling pressure, allowing protocol supporters to purchase PBONDS that burn PIGGY from the market in exchange for a premium in the future, returning PIGGY back to peg.  PSHARE currently mints PIGGY at a rate of 3669.40%!!!  and providing liquidity for PIGGY or PSHARE gives over 13731.28% APR  https://twitter.com/piggy_finance/status/1476610397931114506?s=21* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318694)

    @bobby_blanco --- *Then simply send avax to your MetaMask avax address .. go to traderjoe .. swap avax for time … time will appear on your MetaMask wallet make sure you leave at least half an avax on your MetaMask at all times for gas fees .. then go to wonderland.money click connect and click stake .. and done* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318487)

    @CypherBlock --- *I'd be happy to send you my Node ID and you can use wallet.avax.network to delegate your avax there. My staking period ends in 17 days,  so if you want to try out delegating that is a good place to start (I think 14 days is the minimum). I'm doing one month validation periods, so I'll start a new one when this one is over.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318905)

    @ramziakram --- *maybe can try this startegy.can DYOR  deposit avax into benqi for lending  then use benqi avax lp token to put as collateral on defrost finance supervault.  supervault help autocompound your benqi avax  from supervault, you can also mint h20 stablecoin and deposit those h20 stablecoin into h20 curvepool for farming Melt(deforst governance token) at deforst finance.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318852)
