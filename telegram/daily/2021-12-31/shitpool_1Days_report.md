1. **eth, market, btc**

    @ThxBeToWA --- *Because 95% of my investment is in this chain.  Even against btc and eth lately number go upppppp.  PS once again recommend TinyChart token to anyone interested in a very small cap.  Probably no good if you're in 6 figs already though https://tinychart.org/asset/378382099  Token is going to be used to access this site's more advanced features that will be locked away in the next two months, as well as payment for their anti rug liquidity locker due as well.  TinyChart is a first mover in algo charting and the Dev has proven to be a beast so far and has big partnerships to announce as well.  Check their roadmap out.  /shill* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/712988)
