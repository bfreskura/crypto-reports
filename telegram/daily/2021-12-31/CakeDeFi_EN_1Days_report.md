    @frnklfrt --- *DeFiChain DEX offers dBTC-DFI at 78.46% APR while Cake DeFi offers BTC-DFI at 67.97% APR, I'm assuming there's more hoops to jump through to get dBTC paried with DFI for the higher rate as opposed to BTC-DFI, hence the higher APR?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/158460)
