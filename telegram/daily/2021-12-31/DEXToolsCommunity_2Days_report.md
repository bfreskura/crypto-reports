7. **trending, trend, lost**

    @stanes --- *Sorry for your lost. I always avoid trading when I am pissed, best way to make mistakes. Trending spots are decided by an algorithm. It happens sometimes that a scam is able to reach one of these spots, then people start watching the pair and so that make it trend even more... We are constantly improving the algorithm to avoid manipulations but we will probably never be able to guarantee the perfect legitimacy of these spots.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320188)

    @maroraza --- *ya you right but i cant believe i did this stupidity, usually i do check but i was just pissed at couple of project and then saw this trending on top 10 never thought a scam coin can ever trend and just throw in 10k 😤 fucking stupid cant sell them back* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320184)

    @stanes --- *Yeah yeah yeah, we have people like you every days accusing us of that. Then we ask: so if we accept payment for trending, how come you are not able to show any proof or make your own token trend by paying for it?  Then people suddenly shut up. 🤷‍♂️* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/319790)

    @EricCryptoman --- *how was it obvious? it let you sell at the start and it was verified lol* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/319583)

    @sczptix --- *Bro I think it might be one of the biggest rug. Because they’re so incompetent to mark it verified. I personally lost 1Eth and many of people lose a lot more* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/319163)
