    @everyday_burns_a_hole_in_my_soul --- *If 99% of coin will be stacked price would be unrealistically high* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305075)

    @mahirnadi --- *Is this the total amount that will be distirbuted to iota stakers? Or will there be an other airdrop?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305180)

    @Tahmis --- *When staking you will get assembly and shimmer tokens every 10 seconds. The more you stake the more you get* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305191)

    @lalit1414 --- *most coins reached to the height with marketing.. not with tech   No marketing means we will go back to $1 again.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305243)

    @ash1taka1997 --- *100% agreed!  Look at all the extinct species, literally their supply in individual numbers went down to zero and humans didn't bother to save them.  On the other hand, look at pigs, cattle and chicken, they are bred in the millions but still hold up a certain price, because we want to eat them.  For something to hold value, function and utility is much more important than rarity.  That's why I'd rather the 60 Ti be put to good use to make our ecosystem fantastic.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305389)

    @SeifertReid --- *Hey why isn’t IOTA listed yet on KuCoin??* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305217)

    @Matt_Unwin --- *Hello Bill. Making a bold statement like this is worthy of some form of follow up. I am trying to conduct my own research but on other projects it is very valuable to share information and those that have a full grasp will usually help. That’s what TG channels such as this are for. I personally have never got on well with projects where ever question is met with (DYOR). Just be helpful and appreciative of those that are new … their legacy FIAT invested in this is as good as yours.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305299)
