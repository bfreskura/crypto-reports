    @Jose Leni --- *Hi guys. Any news when hydra is going live mainnet?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/764038)

    @Rabbitholepools --- *I welcome the suggestion and will make efforts to anonimise the guide. I feel like a couple of points need to be made though:  I have used this guide on a variety of channels since March and not a single delegation has resulted from it;  There are countless community tools around Cardano which not so subtly point to specific pools (eg brought to you by, etc). Most of these are great tools that make a better user experience of the whole. Some of them i personally consider essential, and i  am sure I don't need to name them. Such tools are not only frequently "advertised" on official channels, but also presented directly to the community by prominent figures in the space. I personally have no issue with that: some SPOs have gone to great lengths to help the community and should be allowed to get some credit for it. Officially or otherwise.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/764010)

    @glitch04 --- *While that is a nice guide this will be the one and only time we ask that you not use it as you advertise the pool within the guide* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/764001)

    @georgelovegrove --- *Final video before the new year on Cardano Contributors League -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wo8yXrX9oM  Discusses how funding contributors directly that have a simple objective to maximise impact could help core parts of the ecosystem like Project Catalyst thrive in 2022.  Have a great new year everyone 😄🎉* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/764177)

    @jared1996z --- *I hope in 2022 cardano project grows exponentially and the ada coin takes top 3. An lovely project👀🎉🎉* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/764230)

5. **balance, nexo, network**

    @Tustyrusty --- *I've spoken to IR about this. They have put a technical doc on Gov.uk I will either treat stake as income or interest on savings or a capital gain based on £0 purchase. I believe all are acceptable. I put exact what I've done in email to accountant. IR will not chastise you if you are genuinely trying to be legit. Worst case they will alter your return which could even be in your favour!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/763957)

    @glitch04 --- *They offer returns based on their own system not the networks native option. Is that a good platform? Sure for many that find it useful but they have different functions. Staking on the network is done with out releasing control of your wallet balance or having lock periods, where as with a platform like Nexo or Celsius you release custody of your assets to them in exchange for interest paid out while they loan your balance (assets) out.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/764079)

    @JudgeDJ --- *Anyone know how staking is taxed in the UK?  Is it from the point you click claim that you get charged income tax?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/763913)

    @Rabbitholepools --- *Ok, it might be worth pointing Antho to one such non-branded staking guide then. Could you please help with that?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/764015)

    @Snowden29 --- *Hallo, is Nexo trusted for staking ur cardano?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/764076)

    @RVarel --- *I have few thousands and wanted to sell few* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/763645)
