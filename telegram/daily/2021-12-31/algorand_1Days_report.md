2. **algorand, solana, language**

    @defirlkp --- *why do you think algorand will grow faster? it uses a different development language doesn't it which reduces the pool of available developers compared to evm-based chains using solidity* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327967)

    @DTX234 --- *I don't understand why ETH Is the number 2 whereas much better blockchain technology exist like Algorand...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327956)

    @bernijw --- *Network Effect. It will take time to develop an ecosystem remotely as huge as Ethereum. Ethereum will stay big, it won't go away, but Algorand will grow much faster. Think about it...Bitcoin is dominant, even though it really can't do anything but store and transfer value (the latter quite slowly), but it has a huge first mover advantage.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327957)
