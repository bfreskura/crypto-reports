    @Tsradibanis --- *May I withdraw my comite balance since Im not on the winner list* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326995)

    @KasyWillss --- *I think rewards in Algo wallet, Atomicwallet and others are accrued daily. Depending on your amount of Algo holding* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326855)

    @Crypt0Playa --- *I subscribed about ~33K Algo and the MyAlgoWallet Governance portal says estimated rewards to be just shy of 6000 tokens. Is this right or an error in the portal?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327119)

    @nicoo1234 --- *Will governance rewards have to be claimed or automatically arrive in the wallet?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327408)

    @ucumgemblung --- *Admin Can i ask about reward for first governance?   Total Reward ÷ Commited = Reward per each algo commited?   60.000.000 / 1.708.506.071,23 = 0,0351184002  So we will get 0.03 algo for every 1 algo commited on first governance?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327202)

5. **address, exchange, send**

    @Martin --- *Hey community , I was wondering if there is any way of increasing the privacy of an account? Cause at the moment everyone can know what assets are being moved from and into an account, right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327023)

    @Pablo_cast --- *Well, more than be desirable, it's how it works. There are some privacy focused blockchains, but they have many problems with exchanges as they could be used to money laundering* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327030)

    @MackDenver --- *That's why it is decentralized, and Algorand blockchain is already secure. Others can see what you are transferring but nobody will know who is transferring.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327029)

    @KAPIBAYSIDE --- *I felt the same way best thing is to have several  address maybe one that you only send crypto to. Send to an exchange first before sending to that wallet address for privacy* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327045)

    @Martin --- *But lets say I have the Wallet Address of a friend, or maybe a stranger with whom I transacted something. Then I will be able to know everything he does just putting that address in Algostats?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327031)

    @KAPIBAYSIDE --- *For example  people can see what coins you are interested  in and staking is that cause for concern ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327420)

6. **isda, metamask, eligiable**

    @NightAlgorand --- *Check out this link for all project built on Algorand https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326867)

    @Cryptovert223 --- *I'm adding to my portfolio and tossing up between algo and Adam. Does anyone have any recommendations on sites to research algo that they found helpful. Please and thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327139)

    @Carlos --- *I am looking forward to help on Algorand vision here in Spain. I would like to know if there is someone on the team that I could talk to* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327080)

8. **period, commit algo, commit**

    @mcmaxims --- *6k per period? thats too much I assume around 1k algo per 30k committed algo per period* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327120)

    @EmekaKingsley --- *I've committed my algo into the period 2  Am I to use it and vote or I should leave it like that there though am not seeing any voting option there* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327322)

9. **tokens, token, link**

    @Croketaa --- *So those are the only existing tokens on algorand at this moment?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326869)

    @mcmaxims --- *If you speak of tokens, there are many more which are not listed there. The link Night sent you lists all "big" projects. There are many small projects and tokens as well.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326875)

    @Croketaa --- *Hey guys, anybody here knows about maricoin token? Its related to algorand Miami acceleration but that’s all I can find online, it’s supposed to be already launched in algorand* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326865)

    @Patdogbaby --- *I'm thinking of launching a token, any good resources to research tokenomics? Max supply, deployment etc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327203)

    @Martin --- *You could certainly create many wallets for this, but looks too complicated for most people. Imagine saving those 20 secret words for 10 different wallets. Furthermore , you could also track the address of the wallet that is transfering tokens into that wallet, right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327035)

    @bogieman8 --- *Any other wallet options?  I have over 30k tokens in Governance but still have some more in the Algorand Wallet…any recommendations?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326858)
