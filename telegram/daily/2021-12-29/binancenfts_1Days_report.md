9. **blockchain, games, game**

    @funraiy --- *Majority of blockchain gaming are often focus more on the blockchain rather the the game itself, as you said.  Related that, how do you compare your project better than others gaming projects?   .* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419873)

    @sylviasavi --- *We sometimes see blockchain games calling themselves that, and it's just wrong* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419806)

    @sylviasavi --- *Yes but it's important to say , that no game on blockchain at the moment can call themselves AAA* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419804)

    @sylviasavi --- *The main problem in blockchain gaming is the current quality of most games- they look like they were developed 20 years ago. Also, they often focus more on the blockchain, rather the the game itself. We say GAMEPLAY FIRST< BLOCKCHAIN SECOND. We believe it's the only sustainable way for blockchain gaming.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419789)

    @landcruiz --- *You mentioned that the main problem in blockchain gaming is the current quality of most games look like they were developed 20 years ago.  How much do you believe that your game is technically more advanced and modern?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419909)

    @spotverse --- *I'm so interested with your statement " GAMEPLAY FIRST,  BLOCKCHAIN SECOND".   Why not by balancing the two 50 50? what is the reason and method of choosing your option?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419893)

    @nuryildiz58 --- *"Sometimes" phrase took interesting when you mention about "Dark Matter Energy, in combination with $GAME Tokens and sometimes combined with $DARK Tokens"   In what cases there would occur a combination? #DarkFrontiers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419897)

    @c_hinmay --- *What are $DARK and $GAME tokenomics? #DarkFrontiers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419886)

    @sylviasavi --- *First of all, $DARK is a BEP-20 token, as we believe it's the most friendly infrastructure for games at the moment. $GAME also has a BEP-20 bridge.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419814)

    @sylviasavi --- *$DARK token will serve as an in-game energy unit. Energy is needed to power the gameplay - travel, mine and merge NFTs. It can also be mined by claiming land on different planets. So $DARK will be very much like the heart and the blood of the game.  $GAME will also be featured, it will act as a booster to certain in-game processes, and you will also be able to buy NFTs with $GAME on Gamestarter marketplace.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/419815)
