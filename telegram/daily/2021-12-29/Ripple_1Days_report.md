6. **sec, ripple, lawsuit**

    @XRPslayer --- *Everyone should just relax. Xrp has a very good position in this crypto market and actually solves problems that we have been battling for years. In my opinion, ripple will blow this case off the face of the earth. Ive been following the lawsuit every single day since it started and if you go and look at all the facts then you will be able to make a decision. When i invested my first bit of money in XRP i told myself that it will be as a 5year investment so im not worried about what it does now while this lawsuit is still happening. Just forget about the price now and relax and forget about the idea that you will become rich overnight. All good things take time, dont rush the market. Let it take its course and practice holding those coins.     Diamond hands!!!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3032420)

    @Lallulu --- *I always believe in ripple as it is a good project and ruined by this sec lawsuit. With present scenario I don’t want to give false hope specially to me. One thing I still hold after 3 years* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3032207)

    @LincolnXtamc4 --- *Most definitely, if sec wins against ripple labs they'll then be going after a lot more projects. So yes SEC needs to be defeated 💪💪* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3031985)

    @Couture_paquette --- *SEC’s XRP Lawsuit: Crypto Analyst Says “We Should All Be Rooting for Ripple To Win” 👌* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3031969)

    @marianmp --- *If it doesn't win over SEC it won't go up.....it will be seen as a security (btw it's false)...but that's the true.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3031803)

    @Nial --- *True. But there’s articles about banks, opening contracts with Ripple, holding A LOT of xrp tokens. Of which you can assume that there is forsure a lot of trust and funding in this coin, since it (might) become a DeFi as soon as the lawsuit ends.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3032670)
