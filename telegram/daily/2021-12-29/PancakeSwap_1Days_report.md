    @cryptotrip7 --- *I just made a transaction of $1000 and I think I may have lost it.  I traded Smart Chain BNB for XYZ token and the swap went through. AFTERWARDS, I realized I had my BNB Smartchain in place instead of my Etherwallet in place (In my BNB Firefox Wallet), and the token is an ether token but the swap was a wrapped BNB to XYZ swap. and I see no coins in my XYZ folder of my BNB wallet now. I fear I may have lost the $1000.  Can anyone here helm me with this, without trying to guide me to some way to connect my wallet and hand over my pass phrase? lol    I just need someone to explain to me what I need to do. Any REAL help is much appreciated.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2229597)
