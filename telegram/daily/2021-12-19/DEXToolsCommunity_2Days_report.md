    @jimmyvee --- *I was a member, and then there was a mini-scandal where they changed some rules about the group, and they said we were allowed to sell our 100K DEXT and still retain our allocations.  So, I'm in the position of not being able to communicate with the team, yet I am due my tokens. Do you have an email address or other way I can contact Frederic?:  He does not respond to DM's on TG.

7. **app, connect, trust wallet**

    @napascual --- *Mobile websockets are not the most stable connections on Trust wallet. They still need to improve a lot (even for Metamask). One trick is to wait on your trust wallet connect screen (instead of going back to the app) and wait until the app sends the Verification (sign) request to your app. For some reason, if you go back to the app the websocket sometimes stops sending data.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314306)
