    @DeeSingh0000 --- *Mate I’m not doing it on purpose… I have something called APENFT in my wallet, that’s why I’m asking about it in this group. This group is called NFT, and I’m talking about APENFT  I was trying to find out what it was, maybe an airdropped NFT. But I still don’t know it is and your no help. The community has been trying to help me by answering my questions. But clearly you won’t, your just giving me warnings.

3. **game, legend, fantasy**

    @Hentopro --- *How to play nft games? What is the name of nft game?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/422390)

    @ThomasLFW --- *In the first game, there are two types of NFT heroes in our LFW game Legend (Ancestor)and Legacy (Disciples) and a variety of on-chain rewards that can be exchanged for LFW tokens. ​​To ensure transparency, the Legend NFTs are only sold via Binance NFT, ApolloX, and GameFI before the game launch and then holders can trade on our NFT Marketplace. All income from the sale will be used to develop products, buy back and provide liquidity.  Introduction about our marketplace is here: https://news.legendfantasywar.com/coming-soon-the-lfw-marketplace-520fddefcca6 LFW Mystery Box II: https://www.binance.com/en/nft/mystery-box/detail?number=1&productId=173304848325765120 Share your thought with community about our NFT here: https://twitter.com/Legend_LFW/status/1476425879706550272* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/421713)

    @ThomasLFW --- *Here is some reasons that our NFT hero is unique when compared to the NFTs from other blockchain game projects.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/421736)

    @ThomasLFW --- *Highlight:   • Legends Marketplace first decentralized marketplace is a complex of DeFi Center, Crypto Asset Management, NFT Exchanges for global users.   • To create a better user experience with scalability by self-developed cross-chain solutions applied for Blockchains project.   • Cross-chain solutions for not only network tokens but also can be used to bridge collections for NFTs.  • Customized for flexibility and scalability.   • Various products related to staking, renting, and minting new NFTs with attractive rewards  • Current Feature of Marketplace is for only the first game Legend of Fantasy War include:  ◦ A fully decentralized marketplace  ◦ Supporting NFTs asset management  ◦ Various NFTs products including Heros, Equipment, Consumables, Fastions, and also Lands  ◦ Gem Center for Currency exchange, liquidity provider* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/421726)

    @ThomasLFW --- *By playing the game, experiencing the game you will have the opportunity to collect rare and valuable items. This is the first version, you only need to collect on-chain treasure chests and can sell them on our marketplace. But if you open the chest, if you are lucky, you will receive an extremely valuable prize such as an NFT worth thousands of USDT.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/421751)

    @ThomasLFW --- *At LFW, when user has a NFT hero, it means they have true ownership with it. Players no longer have to overpay for in-game items they don't have the right to own. In addition, they also have the opportunity to earn many other valuable rewards. Imagine, you play games, and your family supports you. It's my dream and I believe many people have the same situation 😄* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/421734)
