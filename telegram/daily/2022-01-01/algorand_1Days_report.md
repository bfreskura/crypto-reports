3. **solana, luna, language**

    @DTX234 --- *I don't understand why ETH Is the number 2 whereas much better blockchain technology exist like Algorand...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327956)

    @bernijw --- *Network Effect. It will take time to develop an ecosystem remotely as huge as Ethereum. Ethereum will stay big, it won't go away, but Algorand will grow much faster. Think about it...Bitcoin is dominant, even though it really can't do anything but store and transfer value (the latter quite slowly), but it has a huge first mover advantage.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327957)

    @defirlkp --- *why do you think algorand will grow faster? it uses a different development language doesn't it which reduces the pool of available developers compared to evm-based chains using solidity* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327967)

    @Teo --- *Important decision. I kindly ask you for your opinion. Why prefer algo to solana and terra luna today? thank you very much for your availability* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/328012)

    @defirlkp --- *i'm also looking at the future - all i said is because algorand uses a different language it can only draw from a smaller pool of developers which may slow down work* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327977)

    @Nakibruce --- *Network doeant go down like solana algos devs much better tech much better and isn't reliant on a flawed stable coin base price model like luna or a delegated aystem like luna* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/328405)
