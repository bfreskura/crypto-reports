    @kp773 --- *Hello, in which Wallet do you recommend saving chainlink to have it in the long term?  I would not like to have it long term in an exchange.. and under what network would the chainlink be stored in a Wallet?  under the ETH network?  why for example, I use Trust Wallet, and there I can store chainlink, in ETH network and also in Binance's BEP2 network, but I don't know how good it would be to save them in Binance network .. the good thing about the network of Binance are the low commissions when sending them and when withdrawing them since in the ETH network the commissions are high .. but I feel that it is safer to save them in the ERC20 network .. what do you think?  any advice?  thank you very much group* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/358581)
