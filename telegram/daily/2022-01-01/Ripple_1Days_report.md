    @NSantan --- *Not sure at what rate you've bought your XRP and what your situation is, but a general plan would be to not sell and just sit on the investment.   At least hold till you think you have found a better investment, again it isn't an actual loss till you hit the sell button* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3033691)

    @neliedechavez --- *So is the court case the only thing holding it back?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3033556)

    @Hendrikhaverkamp22 --- *Google translate . The infamous lawsuit between Ripple (XRP) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been going on for a year and the judge has still not given a final verdict. The lawsuit hangs like a dark cloud over Ripple, but according to a lawyer for the company, the end is in sight. Ripple is accused by the SEC of illegally selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Ripple, of course, strongly disagrees with these SEC allegations. Ripple lawsuit Attorney Jeremy Hogan, who serves as a legal counsel to the XRP2 project, expects the lawsuit to conclude in the first half of next year. According to him, it is likely that the chapter will close in April. A worst-case scenario, according to Hogan, is an end to the lawsuit in the summer of 2022.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3033710)

    @NSantan --- *It's a great token, but the crooks over at the SEC are trying to drown it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3033214)

    @dZaTom --- *The outcome of the lawsuit against Ripple will be important for the crypto industry, as it may influence how other digital assets are regulated by the SEC in the future. Although regulators have stated that Bitcoin and Ether are not securities in the US, they have not given the same exemption to other tokens, which has caused many to fear that other cryptocurrencies may potentially face SEC lawsuits in the future, just like XRP did.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3033468)
