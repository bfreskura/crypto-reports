1. **, days, supply**

    @Pantra86 --- *I am thinking about selling iota afte staking or in the middle of it even. In this way it will never go to the moon* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305249)

    @punikus --- *Guys, until the stake event I was not aware of IOTA's existence. I am about two years into crypto and I never saw a project like this. Now I believe that this one's gonna change everything. Happy holydays everybody* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305468)

    @lalit1414 --- *Now the supply may be reduced for 3 months but it really doesn’t make a dent on price because there is no FOMO at all.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305247)

    @satoshi_legend --- *Iota was recently listed on Kucoin I believe.  ~Let's keep spreading the global adoption of IOTA.~  The free market should and will decide IOTA's true value.  IOTA with its directed acyclic graph, and advanced infrastructure - it has all the pieces to become the leading cryptocurrency in the transition to web 3.0 - era of Internet of Things (IOT), 5G (partnership w/ TMobile, Huawei, Fujitsu), connected Robotics (partner w/ ABB), automotive connectivity (partnership with VW & German car makers), Smart City, & Metaverse.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305416)

    @lalit1414 --- *How many people from crypto space knows IOTA started staking in 2 different tokens ??  There is no one from outside even talking about it..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305239)

3. **time, wallet, time stake**

    @ef4ort --- *What i mean is that  if you are not seeing it in your wallet its just as bad as you not having it the first place . and the evidence of convincing them without an email confirming the staking will be hard to prove even with the screenshot* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305485)

    @Bartleby --- *Is it possible to stake any time we want or is there definite starting time ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305262)

    @ef4ort --- *But if that happens and you restore your wallet using your mnemonic phrase you should be able to get everything back as it was when u staked it with your staking rewards intact   i would expect but my friend found an empty wallet still showing no trace at all of any transactions whatsoever.. Could that have been an external intrusion happening within the last 24 hours while NY festivities was ongoing ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305465)

    @ash1taka1997 --- *Oh yeah I forgot that one, we have a voting event yet to come.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305385)

    @punikus --- *you don't need to split your stake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305208)

    @Pantra86 --- *But i am wondering why there is no marketin & an strong community* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305442)

    @Skypies --- *Hello admin good morning. Please I sent my oita from binance to my firefly wallet like 6 hours ago but till now, I am yet to see the iota tokens reflect on my firefly wallet though it’s saying transaction completed on Binance.

    @DanielWolfFIT --- *hey guys - one question. Was sending IOTA via 2 firefly wallets today 2 hours ago. from the sending adress the token already went away and in the tangle it seems the tx went through. but the reciever adresse still havent got the amount. what s the issue about that?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305328)

    @David --- *Withdrew from Binance successfully and now staked in Firefly - all good 🙏* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305308)

    @ElmettS96 --- *No, Firefly don't give the possibility (in this moment) to buy directly IOTA, you can buy it from different exchange (Binance Bitpanda bitfinex ecc) and then send to Firefly in order to stake it for shimmer and assembly crypto, but consider that this week Binance often suspend withdrawal.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305228)
