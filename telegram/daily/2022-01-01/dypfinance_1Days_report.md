5. **pending, transaction, pending transaction**

    @hemanrock --- *please check on internet about (nonce) or how to fast pending tx.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235828)

    @appliepietrade --- *soemthing is no right. when i do approve, it is pretty much instant* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235673)

    @Globbysats --- *when i hover it doesnt do anything and its been 60 days 11 hrs* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235585)

    @hemanrock --- *Please hover to withdraw button to see remaining days* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235584)

    @appliepietrade --- *Hi admin, is there anything that you can do for a pending transaction(deposit) that is lasting for more than 11 hours and still pending?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235826)

    @appliepietrade --- *Hi admin, i talked to you last night about my staking in eth network. I reapproved and tried to do the deposit now, but it has been 17 minutes after I hit the deposit and it is still pending, is this normal?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235661)

6. **staking, reinvest, stake**

    @appliepietrade --- *now let me ask you another question. There is an option for reinvest for the staking reward. I don't quite understand it. Let's say I staked 1000 dyp and i have 10 dyp for the rewards, if I click reinvest, does this 10 dyp add back to the 1000 to get the compound?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235831)

    @appliepietrade --- *thanks sir!  I understand that reinvesting will need gas fee, so I will definitely take this into account when I do reinvest. Now thank you very much for answering my question. Happy new year to you Sir!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235836)

    @robertqin86 --- *I just reinvested so I can answer this qn. Ur stake amt after reinvesting is 1010 dyp. If u are eligible to withdraw after ur lock in period it will also be 1010. Do note that reinvesting will require eth gas fees so do ur own calculations on when is the best time to reinvest.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235832)

    @StillHodlTulips --- *Hey all, the iDYP from airdrop is now staking away nicely (vested over 12 months I believe). After those 12 months, is there a place to stake them then? Or does staking iDYP continue after 12 months* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235772)

    @appliepietrade --- *Hi Admin, ask you a question regarding the staking 90 days, does it mean after 90 days is up, the staking amount will return back to me for withdraw or i can continue to do the staking?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235881)

    @appliepietrade --- *yeah, that is what I am thinking. The rewards must be big enough to perform this claim or reinvest.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235846)

7. **tvl, going, share**

    @chunshern90 --- *Why TVL and "My Share" keep going down?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235636)

    @BigGUN01 --- *what's going on, the value keeps dropping down considerably* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235621)

    @hosimo --- *Is that related to TVL in the contract* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235726)

    @QTMiner --- *TVL could be goin down due to the whole crypto market taking a dip* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235641)

    @QTMiner --- *TVL is going up as other people deposit, so your share of X is still X/TVL but if TVL goes up your gate gets smaller* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235639)

    @chunshern90 --- *but looks like TVL and "My Share" going down at the same time..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235638)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *If you are asking about knowing USD value of your LP you can find it on Stats page* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/236017)

    @hosimo --- *Since i deposit the lp its decresed 400% 😂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235731)

    @hosimo --- *I mean by raising the price of both the LP RAISE or if one of them also increased the lp increase as well?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/235727)
