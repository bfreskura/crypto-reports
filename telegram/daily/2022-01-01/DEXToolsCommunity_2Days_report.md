    @CryptoCoinRahman --- *i have a question for admins.  If I launch a token, and part of the community involvement is to encourage the community to go onto dextools, register, and follow the socials links for our token....to do this manually, as humans...no bots.  Does Dextools watch token TGs for this, and delist tokens for this?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320403)

    @cyK3r --- *Hi, I have a question. We launched Dragon Infinity 2 months ago and we had an issue, as we did it again under Dragon Infinity v2.. and we had an issue again. We will launch on Monday once again. My question is, can we hide the other two from Dex so it doesn't show anymore? We want to use Dragon Infinity as name.. On poocoin it works after a while, but on dex, it still shows. And we don't want our investors to look or buy the wrong token.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320320)
