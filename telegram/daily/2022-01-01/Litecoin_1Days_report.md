1. **pos, money, care**

    @BennyBennyBlanco --- *Defi is the future, investors want something back for their holdings. Not everyone has mining machines. The cost of using electricity to run that equipment makes your bills more expensive. Your ltc is worth less than your electricity bill, electricity bill becomes way  too expensive to continue saving up, Not worth it. Staking is the future* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2037528)

    @BillyRoc --- *This group is often (daily) for fudders to spread misinformation and fear to wreck noobies while the fudders actually accumulate.   For an official LTC forum try Litecoin . io or Twitter or Clubhouse or even better digging through news.   Those who speak about OmniLite, Mimblewimble, Flare and other projects coming to LTC are often banned here. Good luck!  See a crying frog or incessant fudder here,expect to see good news of LTC elsewhere.   I see nonsense here and I get ready to buy. I feel sorry for the noobies that fell for the daily fudders here thinking this is an official room. I’m certainly accumulating (just like they are but don’t readily admit here.)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2038191)
