    @Mats_1992 --- *Can i swap DFI to BTC?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/158437)

    @Albert --- *I could not wrap my mind around the risk of LM. What will happen for LM dbtc-dfi if BTC goes to 60,000usd but dfi drop to 1.5, similar what will happen if BTC drop to 30k, and dfi goes to 30 USD? How will the LM be affected?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/158725)

    @Kassius84 --- *You need to withdraw your DFI via Ethereum Network as ERC20 Token. You need to define the DFI AS Custom token in your MM. Here you will find the needed contract adress and some further informations. But be aware of the high Ethereum gas fees 👍  https://blog.cakedefi.com/another-sweet-transfer-option-erc-20-version-of-the-dfi-coin/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/158544)

    @frnklfrt --- *DeFiChain DEX offers dBTC-DFI at 78.46% APR while Cake DeFi offers BTC-DFI at 67.97% APR, I'm assuming there's more hoops to jump through to get dBTC paried with DFI for the higher rate as opposed to BTC-DFI, hence the higher APR?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/158460)
