    @Xieon1 --- *I know both of that. What threw me is that official website lists the TRN token ID as their official ID and their pancake swap for that chain.   I don't think it's a fake token like the others, maybe a slick way to drive up hype, but a ton of users will eventually come to them and say hey you said token #xxxx is official on Tron...whats going on.
