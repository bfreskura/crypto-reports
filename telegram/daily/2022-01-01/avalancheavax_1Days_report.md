2. **piggy, avax chain, time**

    @FutureTiger --- *Hullo chaps, when withdrawing AVAX from gateIO, I am offered 2 Chains, AVAX chain and AVAX C-Chain. The fee for AVAX chain is small but AVAX C-Chain is very expensive. Is it safe to send AVAX from Gate to Metamask using AVAX Chain? If it is not safe, perhaps I should buy TIME on gateIO itself, and then send TIME to MM using AVAX C-Chain. For some mysterious reason the fee is small when withdrawing TIME from Gate using AVAX C-Chain !* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318702)

    @Timur --- *https://twitter.com/nfdnaclub/status/1477297984807313409?s=20 hey friends we have a avax based nft and we are doing giveaway chheck this out* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/319017)

    @bobby_blanco --- *You use the c chain for that sort of stuff .. because gate.io is an exchange they are on the x chain.. you need to move it from the x chain to the c chain .. and then send it to your MetaMask wallet .. if you can buy the time on gate.io and send it to your MetaMask you will be saving a swap feee on trader joe.. once the time is in your MetaMask you then connect your MetaMask to the time website make sure you get the official one and click stake .. make sure there is at least half an avax in your MetaMask wallet for gas fees although these should be only a few cents .. but always good to have some avax there for peace of mind* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318710)

    @ghoti42 --- *I started a transfer on the Avalanche Bridge, ETH from Ethereum to Avalanche, about 20 minutes ago.  The avax bridge still shows the balance on Ethereum, even though my wallet doesn't agree.  How long does the bridge usually take?  Is there a 2nd step i'm missing?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/319016)
