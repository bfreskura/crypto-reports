    @JustNNM --- *Price wise i have no idea.  It doesn’t need to be a stable currency to bridge different currencies.  Ill break it down to the most simple understanding Us sends $10 > XRP bridges with $10 worth > out pops the other currency equivalent to the $10  XRP could be priced at 1 billion but you only need $10 worth for that bridge, so a drop of an XRP* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3048495)

4. **ledger, zero, safepal**

    @TheRealPrussian --- *No worries or rush.  I got a little cheap SafePal hardware that a friend recommended while I wait on the Zero and following the videos and directions didn’t work once I needed to add the currencies.  Must have been a bug.  Do not recommend.  Plus it only works with SafePal so that’s an issue as well.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3048354)

    @TheRealPrussian --- *If I had android I would have went with the nano as well.  It’s cold and you can get 3 for the price of 1 ledger x!  It’s a good buy in my opinion.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3048346)

    @TheRealPrussian --- *Personally I’m on the waiting list for the NGRAVE Zero.  It’s supposed to be the coldest of the cold wallets.  Not sure on the price but seemed like it would be comparable to the ledger x price wise.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3048344)

    @TheRealPrussian --- *It’s a good one just not OS operation system compatible unfortunately.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3048342)
