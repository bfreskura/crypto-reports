    @WILD5STYL3 --- *don't message to sync my wallet f**ing scammers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/646482)

    @Mcjig --- *[Forwarded from Mcjigs(will never dm first)] Common sense rules to help protect your crypto 1. Never ever share your seed phrase( thats like giving your password to access your funds) 2. Admins or support will never private message you first If you receive a private message with offers to help 99% of the time its a scam 3. Best security is to use a cold wallet(ledger,trezor) 4. There is no such thing as visiting a website to resync or validate your wallet 5. 100% of the time. Issues can be fixed. Seed phrase is never required 6. Always write down your seed phrase and store in a safe place and download your keystore If you dont have either of those. Then you will never be able to access your funds 7. There are NO Airdrops. If your asked to send funds with a promise of more funds in return* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/646675)

    @thiagorochaoc --- *I know. Let me explain again: anyone needs 500k FTM staked to be a validator. My question is, does it really need 500k FTM or does that amount take into account the delegated values for that validator?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/646010)

    @Mcjig --- *2/3 rds of the validators have to come to a consensus to approve* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/646077)
