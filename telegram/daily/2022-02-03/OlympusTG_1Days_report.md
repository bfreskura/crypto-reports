1. **investment, invested, 40k**

    @David IL --- *Seriously it's bad. Wasting 12 months to break even. Wtf. How about investing in Btc at least you can make 10% profit and not losing sleep* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177486)

    @David IL --- *It's not. But god damn it i wish i invested my 50000$ in BTC and top 10 market cap coins.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177293)

    @David IL --- *Sorry. I will never use it again. I am just angry i'm sure you understand hos it feels losing 40K usd dollars.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177350)

    @M --- *If -50% isn't a crash will you wait until down -80% to sell* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177596)

2. **apy, 1000, price**

    @cdp279 --- *Just do the maths. You probs bought at the top. Even if price goes down another 50% and if apy stay 1000% you will make your money back. I don’t think we’ll be going down much further and I think it’s all up from here (NFA)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177852)

    @David IL --- *And how you expect people to trust this if the price keeps getting lower and apy getting lower? 95% down is another story* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177415)

    @nfwaple --- *no I am pretty sure it will stay 500% minimum within the token supply range at the moment, if they want to decrease the APY before we hit the upper token supply range, there would probably be a proposal* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177903)

    @timon_k --- *how much is the apy going to go down in the next few months?  I don’t think the price would go down much more, but the APY keeps declining, can’t calculate against that if I don’t know* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/178103)

    @nfwaple --- *learn about the protocol, the apy is not for this purpose, the supply expands by the same percentage as well* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177221)

    @TNrafi2109 --- *Yes it still can go below 500% or even to 100%. Because the apy is the function of supply and other variables* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177900)
