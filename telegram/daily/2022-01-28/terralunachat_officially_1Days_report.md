    @argon7799 --- *Hello. I have terra station extension wallet. I did a test transfer to the wallet address at the top of the wallet window. It has been completed and there is a successful transaction id on terra finder. But now the address at the top of my wallet window is different! So no funds are seen in the wallet. Any ideas?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/terralunachat_officially/24596)
