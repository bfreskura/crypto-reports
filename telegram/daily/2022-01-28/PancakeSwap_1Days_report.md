1. **bnb, swap, cake bnb**

    @Ceddi200 --- *You swap 277 MSH for BNB and you received 0.039 BNB* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2309162)

    @Sharad --- *Hey, I recently swapped my BNB to CNFT and it pumped and when I went to swap my token back to BNB it kept telling me to enable CNFT before I can swap it. So I was like cool I'll enable and swap the token back to BNB, I clicked enable CNFT, the metamask thing popped up in the top left of the screen I "Approved the token spend" and then when I went back to swap it both of the options were greyed out. So I was wondering: 1. What do you do after enabling to swap that token back to BNB? 2. How do I set that up? 3. And why did it keep greying out even after I enabled it like 50 times, like why it would not let me swap it back to BNB. Also I had enough BNB left for the gas fees, and I also just increased the slipping tolerance just so I could swap but it still wouldn't let me. Please refer to the images below for what happened.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2308564)

    @Bob --- *What currency is the BNB refunded in when withdrawing from a cake/bnb LP?  I am still not seeing any new BNB in my wallet from yesterday. I got the cake back but not the BNB. Is it main BNB, Smartchain, WBNB?  0xceeb8c7e617efd14dcb0c61e9432021279203ce90bf1a62907cd36fbc1c74d1d* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2308029)

    @Kimberleycody --- *Hi admin, any reply from the devs? Round 39,799 was canceled but my position of 0.1 BNB wasn’t returned to me and showed I lost that round instead. There is no “closed price” either which also shows the round was canceled.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2308244)

    @papamikepro --- *Hi, could you help me with the following issue? I was staking CAKE to earn APX and have already earned 199+ APX. I wanted to increase my CAKE stake in the pool to earn more APX. Therefore, I withdrew my CAKE from AutoCAKE pool. Once that was completed, I have increased the "Stake CAKE, Earn APX Pool" by depositing the CAKE I previously withdrew. Now my 199 APX earned earlier have disappeared. They are not shown on your website and they are not in my wallet either. Thanks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2305245)
