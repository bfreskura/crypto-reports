    @North --- *Are we as the community allowed to talk about it here even or will posts be deleted? I had no idea it was even running yet, I thought you guys were still working on tokenomics and going to release more info* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36740)

    @North --- *@jakovtradingmentor what do you think about timing of any shilling to Chiliz community?

    @North --- *Fomo will increase as it gets towards  $500K. No way this doesn't get funded. Great news and hopefully we get some more details for AmpNet once we know it's going ahead* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36773)
