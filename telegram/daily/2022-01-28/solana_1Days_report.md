    @H4n0nc0q --- *Right now, I am getting 3 tomato bot messeges and it’s getting annoying. I know that not everybody has a discord, but I really believe telegram is not the best way to connect, if you are getting spammed the second you ask a question. You have to scroll through nude selling spam persons and idk. I just got a phone call from a solana help desk dude who wishes that my mum gets aids. That’s not anyone fault but you’re less likely to get spammed in discord. So revered the tech discord, why not a discord for price and general Info?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/922495)
