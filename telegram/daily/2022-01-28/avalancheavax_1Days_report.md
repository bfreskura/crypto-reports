    @Nicolas_A --- *It could be that the amount of unlocks from vesting this year amount to 20% of current supply.

    @scarcitywhale --- *I’m not sure why someone having a “thick African accent” is relevant or necessarily means they don’t work for Avalanche. Your thought process is deeply problematic.

8. **certificate, covid, vaccine**

    @Talux --- *I for one am glad that anti vaxxers aren't allowed* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324970)

    @seitanic --- *It's in Barcelona, Catalonia, which has abolished all vaccine mandates. So at this point it's not about where the event/venue is, but more about what the host desires. So in this case Avalanche is unnecessarily enforcing a vaccine mandate on attendees, sad times...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324926)

    @neirenoir --- *Mostly because someone with a recent Certificate of Recovery is probably more protected against COVID than someone with a year old Certificate of Vaccination with two doses. Doesn't make sense not to accept all certificates.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325037)
