2. **monsterra, game, play**

    @thangmd --- *These are some of the most important milestones for our Monsterra game project. Yet, I think the community would love to have a comprehensive view on our well-defined roadmoad. Here are the other development stages for your information: https://whitepaper.monsterra.io/roadmap/2021-2022-roadmap* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/445233)

    @NeyNeySGD13 --- *What's up @thangmd, With this #AMA, I understand better the purpose of #Monsterra, it is rather interesting, I have one questions:  What are the optimizations made so that the game is not extremely advantageous for people who have put lot of money and people who just put little in the game and that Play2Earn remains a Play2Earn and not a Pay2Win ?   Thanks #Monsterra* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/445263)

    @Atbrightone --- *I was reading your white paper and you describe monsterra as a free to play and earn Blockchain game However there are thousands of other Blockchain games that refer to themselves as being free to play and earn but in reality a player has to purchase very expensive in-game items or pay huge entry fees to be able to earn otherwise you'd play for weeks if not months without earning anything, Can you guarantee that Monsterra will indeed be different from other games and one can play with little or no investment and actually earn ? @thangmd #Monsterra* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/445275)

    @thangmd --- *The game set foot in a fictional world and revolves around farming, property building, and battling other lands with the magical creatures named Mongen. The design of Monsterra combines the free-to-play and free-to-earn model, which allows millions of gaming enthusiasts fun and profit with no initial investment. To make it clear, we can say that Monsterra prioritizes developing the game to elevate user experience: attractive graphics, diverse missions, addictive gameplay from food production, animal breeding to building your own land, entering fierce battle modes from leading troops to conquering new lands, beating dreadful bosses, raiding other players' lands and confronting forces head-on other real player's troops. Thus, we think Monsterra will be able to attract many more players to come in the long term.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/445210)

    @thangmd --- *The gaming sector is expanding at a rapid pace. With that hasty growth, encountering tough obstacles and backlog problems is inevitable. After conducting research on popular games, Monsterra team found out that there are several problems faced by both gamers and games publishers including:  - High Entry Fee - Poorly Designed Gameplay - Imbalanced Tokenomic Model - High gas fee rate* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/445212)

    @thangmd --- *That's the motivation for us to build Monsterra which is the first premium game in our Monsterra Universe with various innovative solutions to the existing problems above. - Free-To-Play-To-Earn Game Mechanics: Monsterra lets gamers experience a full-fledged core game for free before actually spending on it. In other words, players can enjoy the farming and nurturing ecosystem in Monsterra for free first. Once they find the game addictive and worth investing in, they can spend their money on it afterward. - Play-For-Fun Game Model: Monsterra elevates the game-fun aspect with exciting and inspiring gameplay. We offer an interesting farming ecosystem and 4 fierce battle modes for users to enter with different rewarding structures and battle formats. - Balanced In-Game Economy: Monsterra is well designed with an innovative dual token model to slow down inflation and sustain the in-game balance. We try to keep a balanced amount between the minted and burned in-game token so that the game ecosystem can stay healthy for years to come. - Gas Fee Solution: Users pay no gas fee when getting started with Monsterra game. They will only be charged for transaction fee when converting their assets into NFT items.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/445213)

    @LokeshKamal --- *Bloktopia mid 2022 easy cross 1$* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/446363)

    @PaddyCarroll --- *Bloktopia is a cyberpunk, dystopian inspired virtual reality skyscraper, with world class user experience. Visitors can engage in basic or advanced learning from some of the world leading minds in the Crypto industry - earn revenue, play games with friends, build networks and much more. Think of Bloktopia as a shopping mall, where instead of just retail, each store has a different project, exchange, influencer or crypto brand offering an immersive customer experience. And just because I love crypto, it doesn’t mean that I don’t also like trainers, sport and gaming. Bloktopia will cater for huge global brands in high interest categories. Layered on top of that are places that people can hang out with their friends. And world class event spaces that allow for major sporting talent and musicians to join the metaverse too.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/447087)
