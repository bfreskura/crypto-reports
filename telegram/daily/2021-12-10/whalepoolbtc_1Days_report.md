8. **foot**

    @Painbtc --- *no we are a forum that discusses whale watching, did you know that the Humpbacks can grow to 60 feet (18 meters) long, and they can weigh a whopping 40 tons (about half the size of a blue whale), according to the NOAA. Their flippers can grow up to 16 feet (5 m) long, which is the largest appendage in the world. Their tails are also massive and grow up to 18 feet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4078102)

    @TRotox --- *Yeah...it's been that way for almost 10 years now since the question was first asked. In Ireland and the UK, crypto investments are treated just the same as any other investment. Germany and Portugal are the best European nations for crypto taxation.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4078171)

12. **sophisticated**

    @KickerBTC --- *We have reason to believe a sophisticated sybil attack is underway amongst the crypto communities, after lots of debate it becoming clear there is some large entity behind it, possibly a government. The goal seems to be attack communities with obvious fake spam & fake accounts to discredit the communities enough that people look for alternative platforms (like discord) and our guess is so it's easier for governments to ID people. Please keep this in mind as we work to combat the problem. We have an idea which will be implemented in the upcoming months that should counter these style of attacks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4078018)
