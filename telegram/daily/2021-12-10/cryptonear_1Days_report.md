    @thanano46 --- *I have no powers right now..tony stark stole my gem stones 😷😷* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/231710)

    @avshevchenko --- *Well, I personally feel that Aurora is ‘a compatibility’ part of NEAR. NEAR as a gen3 blockchain allows many new cool things, like advanced accounts with keys management, async execution and sharding. But the ecosystem development would struggle if everything that has been developed within last 7 years of Ethereum existance won’t be compatible with NEAR, right? So, that’s what Aurora does: allows to run Ethereum dApps on NEAR, thus, simplifying and speeding up the development of the NEAR ecosystem.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/230090)
