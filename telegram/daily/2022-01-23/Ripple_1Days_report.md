    @CasperLayer1 --- *So i called the months long downtrend november. Then i called the 58k down, after that the 44k down(a bit later then thought). I called the drop for xrp top 68 when we were 1,10 and told to sell and buy back  So till now got every one right even though people calling me fudder Just because i made the observation that xrp price is shit and behaving like shit. We are like 1600 days! without ATH.  So whats next? As i said after Breaking 44k down which  i said was certain coming in like 2 weeks i would take another look.  Wellllll here it Comes! Were ruined!

    @philip_218 --- *SEC Commissioner Says Crypto Doesn’t Require Special Regulatory Framework  One SEC Commissioner says that the watchdog’s regulatory policy is enough to oversee the cryptocurrency industry. While there have been calls by the cryptocurrency community for the SEC to provide clearer regulation for the industry, one of the agency’s commissioners thinks otherwise.  SEC Does Not Need to Re-Invent the Wheel. Allison Lee, a Commissioner for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), while appearing at a D.C. bar event on crypto regulation, has said that cryptocurrencies do not need a special set of rules.

    @NialPial --- *Its cuz they wanna win money, on people shorting on BTC. And since now all those people in short, lose, cuz btc went up a bit, binance makes shtloads of money in only 20 minutes.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044470)

8. **ripple, uae, dubai**

    @Vincent758 --- *The biggest mistake ripple labs will make is to have their central office in Dubai UAE.  I've lived in Dubai for over 10 year's & their law changes like the weather.  I would totally avoid UAE & the rest of the middle east. The only reason why UAE is encouraging Crypto is because they are heavily in debt due to the Expo 2020 disaster.  Most people trading crypto will have their Crypto & assets seized in UAE. Mark it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044659)

    @Jodxb2311 --- *Ripple have had offices in Dubai for some time.  ODL hub for them with alot of remittances.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044612)

    @Cezto --- *Ripple is the only safe bet at this moment, the coin which is resisting most you wanna sell. Then please go on.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044443)

    @arianaparker --- *Jay I wouldn’t say it’s a bad idea but the truth is that those that have spare are buying ripple because once the case is settled you might be surprised to see 10$ and that’s the end of its dump* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044147)

    @FiloB80 --- *You can use Binance savings instead of staking, for example. Not high %, but better than zero.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044300)

    @XRP_Saitama --- *To reverse this market it’s gonna take for Ripple to win the SEC case. That will be the catalyst.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3043899)

9. **app, widget, wallet**

    @Catcher256 --- *And Xumm is a hot wallet like Trust wallet, where you can also buy und swap your crypto currencies?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044157)

    @Jakes1993 --- *Is there any working widgets I can use for android* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044176)

    @anuj90322 --- *Remove widget, Go to app settings and clear data and cache... uninstall app and reinstall app then..login on coinmarket cap app then.. create new widget and refresh widget* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044181)

    @anuj90322 --- *Yes u can use coinmarketcap widget like the one shown below* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044177)

    @Catcher256 --- *So its not a hot wallet? I'm confused 😅* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044163)

    @Briggslet --- *Meta trader 4.. the one for mobile phone.. not desktop* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3043825)

10. **orders, short, open**

    @anuj90322 --- *I hope the short sellers get liquidated as soon as possible* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044338)

    @SaveYourSelf2 --- *If you watch the order books long enough, a majority large orders are drop ceilings and floors. Watch for completion of the orders for true volume.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044466)

    @SaveYourSelf2 --- *By liquidity do you mean at the sell point or the overall open orders?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044475)

    @SaveYourSelf2 --- *That is normal for an exchange to manipulate order books. Keeps them hot. I thought you where refering to the completed orders not just open.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044488)

    @SaveYourSelf2 --- *I see where you are coming from but if 70% of completed future trades are short, you would get that ratio. The open orders book can say whatever ratio it'd like, it is not a true value of volume.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044500)

    @NialPial --- *Its not even possible that 70%+ is shorting rn.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3044494)
