    @iamkemoo --- *Cross-chain A cross-chain is the interoperability between two relatively independent blockchains. In other words, it allows blockchains to speak to one another because they're built in a standardized way.  MultiChain MultiChain allows the creation and tracking of native assets at the blockchain network level. It has built-in blockchain tokens, both the native currency of the chain that can be used for transaction fees and additional assets issued on top.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/295670)

    @instafinanzas --- *Awesome, for example multi chain would be near and ethereum but cross chain could be dvpn and Akash, the latter are independent but they can communicate each other ? Just mentioned the coins for the example sake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/295671)
