    @baskinbeagle --- *Want to know as I understand that IOTA is already fully minted to its total supply and no more IOTA to be issued, what would be the reward for the validators right now?   Can I also conclude that IOTA is under someone control (or centralized)?  Do you have the statistics showing the holding percentage of the wallet that holds the highest amount of IOTA?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/307338)
