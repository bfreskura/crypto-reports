4. **slippage, increase, sell**

    @SecuestPcs --- *1) Increase your slippage, the higher the better  2) Increase your gas (15, 350000)  3) Remove any decimals, use whole numbers and round down (e.g. if you are trying to sell 592038493.20395, type in the amount 592038492 manually)   4) Use a different wallet (safepal, trustwallet, metamask)  5)Try lowering the amount you sell. Some coins got max transaction limit.  6)Ask the coin issuer to either lower the auto liquidity adding threshold or turn off automatic liquidity adding completely.   🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 7)If none of the above work, you've probably bought a coin you cant sell. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨  Here you can check whether the token you bought is a scam. Paste the smart contract address! 👇👇👇👇👇 https://honeypot.rugdoc.io/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2297994)

    @Mallory_vic --- *Am unable to withdraw my transition from a coin despite high slippage, what should I do?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2296068)

    @ajj2882 --- *Did you check if there is any liquidity or enough?  You may have to up slippage.  Liquidity is if people provide no one has to provide so if not enough or high slippage you need to go ask that project to provide more or ask proper slippage to trade it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2296302)

    @FeeDeuspi --- *I genuinely have 0 experience with liquidity providing on PCS sorry :/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2295546)

    @inuwars --- *Well, but old contract will still be live and liquidity will be able to be drained? As I understand we have to add these features and migrate smart contract, but we will have to provide liquidity (btw all tokens are locked and we simply don't have so much tokens) in BNB and token. And only unlock (in 1year) we will be able to complete migration?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2293597)
