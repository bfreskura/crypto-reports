The rest of the FTM tokens are reserved for providing staking rewards to the FTM holders. The rewards depend on governance decisions; however, as of now, it may take 2 years for the FTM token to reach full circulation and distribute all the rewards to staked FTM holders.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/639683)

    @encryptedhashfunction --- *Hi there !! Any help or suggestions are highly appreciated !! I´m stuck after bridging BNB to my Fantom wallet. Now I got BNB in my Fantom wallet but no FTM. I tried that gas fee faucet from Mentasuave01 twice but didn´t recieve it. Is there another faucet ? Thanks in advance !!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/639588)

    @Mcjig --- *Helpful tip: if you want a cheaper alternative than bridging ftm and paying eth gas From binance or kucoin, get bnb and withdraw as bep20, then use a bridge To bridge bnb bep20 to bnb fantom. Then use spiritswap to swap bnb to ftm spiritswap send 0.4 ftm for 1st time users and https://www.mentasuave01-tools.com/ sends you if you use spooky/multichain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/639693)
