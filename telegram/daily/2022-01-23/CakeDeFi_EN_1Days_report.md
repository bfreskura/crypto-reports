4. **ltc, dbtc, wallet**

    @John --- *Yes Jess I transferred DFI from cake to desktop DEFI walled, well received the amount then transferred to dBTC and now want to send the dBTC to cake for Lending. I have 22 DFI in UTXO not sure what I am missing here 😬* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167415)

    @DoEvtgInLove --- *Hi friends, if I send dBTC to Cake to unwrap I will get BTC at Oracle price?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167420)

    @gpkiefer --- *Question: if I wished to utilize the LM on the Defi desktop wallet for say, LTC-DFI pair, do I transfer my LTC from say Ledger wallet first to Cake to be wrapped/converted to dLTC and afterwards, transfer back to the Defi wallet in order to initiate the LM for the LTC-DFI pair?  Also if I wanted to convert back to LTC do I then transfer the dLTC back to Cake so I can withdraw LTC back to Ledger once I am done with LM?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167281)

    @gpkiefer --- *Thanks for clarification.  So the reverse is also true.  When converting back to the native coin, LTC from the tokenized form, dLTC, it is done on Cake and afterwards can transfer out to any CEX or wallet like Ledger ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167285)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *Yes, you can send the dLTC to Cake and withdraw real LTC from Cake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167286)

    @Kassius84 --- *You will change your dBTC 1=1 in BTC 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167426)
