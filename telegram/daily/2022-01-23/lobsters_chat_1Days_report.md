1. **price, market, liquidation**

    @Felix --- *What about organizing a liquidation of all short sellers?   If each person of this group buys for $100k of stable on Binance at a similar time, that’s $1.7bn. that would basically liquidate all short sellers and bring BTC to $65k* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/317864)

    @RobAnon --- *I suppose it'd be fairly false of me to say that no capital is locked, whoever provides liquidity to the system does get locked into that for a period.
