    @Mad4mp3z --- *Hello, im part of the team at $rickmortydoxx , we have gone through a rebrand and would like the links on the dextools page to reflect the changes rather than going to dead link which they currently do, its not a great image as you can imagine, we lost access to our old socials when a team member left and took the logins with him and the website got migrated from wordpress to azure and we let the old link die thus we cant just forward the page to the new one unfortnatly, how would i go about getting the new socials and websiite updated on dextools* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/327159)

    @bastardganpunk --- *You just need to update the socials on cmc or coingecko. Dextools fetches all info from there* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/327162)
