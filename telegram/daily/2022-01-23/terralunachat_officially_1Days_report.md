    @Daniel_Briano --- *Just tried to answer you and got kicked for using some prohibited word ... Let's give it another try ...  No, I gave up for now. After using the internal function to swap staking rewards to SCRT I have no funds for fees as of now. When I get the next staking rewards, I will probably swap back to LUNA, send these to Binance, sell and buy SCRT and then send these to my Keplr wallet for staking SCRT.  Cumbersome but I don't know what else I could do* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/terralunachat_officially/24313)
