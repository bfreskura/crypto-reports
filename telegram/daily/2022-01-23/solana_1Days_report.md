3. **btc, coin, coins**

    @southy33 --- *No. This isn’t just sol.  The whole bear market has started. I noticed this back in 2017-2018.   We have had a nice ride up. Now we will get people that are going to take profit and more will follow suit. It’s called FUD, if you look at the charts. Go back to beginning of 2018 charts and see for your self with the tip 10 coins then. And the whole MC. We will get a side ways moves for a while then this will restart.   I’m just annoyed I didn’t TP earlier.   My plan chamge to stable coin and wait it out. Probably add Stable coin LP into a pool while I wait for a nice entry. 😬* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/913898)
