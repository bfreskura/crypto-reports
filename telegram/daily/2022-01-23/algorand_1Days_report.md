6. **tps, average, peak**

    @MackDenver --- *Hello Giuseppe, Peak TPS is the highest TPS and average is the average one.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/334515)

    @Kaypacha --- *How is it possible that the average is 23 and highest is 1100?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/334530)

    @Kaypacha --- *Can someone explain to me what's the difference between Peak TPS and Average TPS that I found on Algorand Metrics? The peak is 1100 TPS, the average is 23 TPS. How is it possible such a big difference?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/334508)

    @Malvo --- *Greetings can anyone tell me has algorand upgraded the network to 46,000 TPS as was told to happen* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/334431)

    @Cecco --- *Giuseppe man!! Sveglia raga!! I think that algorand can handle a maximum of 1100 transaction per second, but right now it is doing an average of 23 TPS because that's the traffic, i think they are not hurry to made algorand with the possibility of 46000tps because we don't need it right now, right now i think is better to try to let grow the ecosystem and number of people involved, still we have plenty of space for new people before the need of such a big tsp number.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/334534)

    @Cecco --- *I don't know really, but i think that that peak (if it's ever been reached) it's been reached just as a test (maybe in the testnet?) Anyway should be interesting an answer from somebody that knows it for sure from Algorand* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/334546)
