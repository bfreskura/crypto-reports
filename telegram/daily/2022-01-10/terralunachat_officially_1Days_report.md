    @Don_Papichul0 --- *Go to your station wallet and copy the address.   On binance make sure you read the instructions if they ask for a memo then provide it. You’ll find the memo on the Terra station usually in the same area as your wallet address.   Copy your Terra station wallet address and paste it into Luna on binance.   Remember you withdraw on binance and receiving it on Terra station walllet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/terralunachat_officially/23290)
