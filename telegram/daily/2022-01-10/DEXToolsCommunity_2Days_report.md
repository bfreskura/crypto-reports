    @wadon1 --- *Ok, but why should I pay for it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/322881)

7. **contract, maker, sells**

    @mr_tapity_tap --- *Contract is doing 3 sells. A wallet initiated the sell. But the router or liquidity pool for rewards token is listed as maker.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323678)

    @mr_tapity_tap --- *Hi,  I see there are some issues reported with Maker already.  I'm with a project where almost all sells seems to have the same maker, and in this case it's the pool for the rewards tokens which gets extracted as maker. WBNB/BTCB.  Is it possible to take a look at this? Afaik it would be a common issue with all baby token clones. (Seen it in at least two that I've been involved with)  I might cause panic when investors think it's a whale selling.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323663)

    @stanes --- *Same with this one, contract is doing 4 sells.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323679)

    @stanes --- *Thanks, for so this one you can see that the contract is indeed doing 4 different sell for one tx.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323676)

    @stanes --- *You first need to give the autorisation to the contract to spend your tokens.  You only need to approve it once for each token.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/322880)

    @stanes --- *Yes, you are correct about the maker, I will see with the devs. But about the number of tx I am not sure they can/should do something.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323681)
