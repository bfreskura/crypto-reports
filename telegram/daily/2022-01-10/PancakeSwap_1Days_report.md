    @kineticmass --- *My cake is still in the IFO pool. Do I need to unstake and re-stake for the new timer starting tomorrow?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2260650)

    @Frankjankjink --- *Chefs pls It's high time you make the requirements for IFO very strict, in order to reduce the number of participants. So that we can also have a meaningful IFO that is worth it.  1. Anyone without up to 1000points won't be able to participate in the IFO 2. You have to stake your cake for atleast 30days to be able to partake in the IFO 3. You must have atleast 3NFTs in your wallet to participate in the IFO. ETC.  These are samples on how to make the IFO strict. And It  definitely increase the price of cake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2260225)
