1. **metaverse, axs, play**

    @MoneroPal --- *Can someone explain how variosu cities around the world are being added to the metaverse, what is stopping another project using another chain from just recreating those said cities in their own metaverse or version of it? It seems extremely stupid at this point...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/715489)

    @Blazmeen --- *People need to remind themselves that this is a P2E game and it is no longer fun or profitable for the average user. Of course it's dumping.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/715179)

    @Blazmeen --- *Tbh I'm surprised ppl don't generally consider the market audience for metaverses. Assuming we're talking about gamers - are they really going to dole out $100k-$2.5M to buy land off an investor? Or $XXX to rent it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/715527)

3. **link, posts, news**

    @BeAMightyKing --- *Here's how I'd play Chainlink today, as I'd found much more consistent levels on the BTC pair back when I'd traded it from its mainnet (April 2019) thru late 2020. It might see trouble around the 0.618 fib retracement from ATH in sats, ~0.0012. That's around $51 - $52 according to BTC's current price, coincidentally at prior USD ATH @brendanplayford   LINK-BTC:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/YQa455vt/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/715473)
