1. **staking, validator, rewards**

    @imyourbossnow --- *it sounds staking still have a risk for staking... i want 100% safe for staking. Can you help me? because i want hold XRD for long term for staking* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/336605)

    @LowKep --- *So I just have to look for the lowest fee and the uptime?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/336798)

    @conorbyrne1234 --- *Quick question: xrd rewards are compounded, so do those staking rewards go back to your wallet prior to being given back to the validator or do they stay with the validator.  The end question is, if emission rewards can be lost, are we talking 1 emission worth or can it be the entire time you're staking on a validator.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/336855)

5. **radix_dlt, 11, tps**

    @soulkiller7 --- *And we need to be honest with ourselves about this information asymmetry. General public will NEVER know what atomic composability means or sharding for that matter.   We need to just show confidence in what we’re saying and when saying it make sure it’s logically sound with respect to growth and future potential.   After trying to explain to someone new why you have invested In Radix over anything else all they will understand is “ crypto needs to be faster and only radix can do it”   I’m not trying to be pompous In anyway but it’s the truth.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/336581)

    @lwtel --- *Just realized they don't have plans to shard(inevitable scaling issues) and they're a dag, even though they're using a novel variant of honeybadger bft, because the consensus isn't cross-shard by default, when they realize they'll need to shard in order to scale other stuff breaks(atomicity).  tl;dr unsharded dag won't scale imo  I was told this by a quite smart member of the radix community who took a look at azero* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/337074)

    @ITProfligate --- *#L2 Please comment if interested. TPS and fees, my understanding is the ETH L2 have solved congestion up to something like 20000 TPS (18000 is the given figue) for transfers. I do not know what this means about communicating with other L2s or about recursive scaling as suggested by Starkware. I do not know how this applies to ETH2  L2 solutions seem to me to break various things PoS -> this may matter in terms of skin in the game and decentralisation Looking at the Starkware contract (which is actually self-contradictory or inconsistant) we seem to be looking at a territory governed by the law as exists in that contract. I would think this makes creating, for instance, DOAs, very complex since while expressing their own rules they also have to comply with the pre-existing set of legal agreements.  Cross chain or cross L2 solutions Subject to technical difficulties concerning resolving final state on L1 - which is the security guarantor There is at least one chain that acts across L2’s - I haven’t looked into it but believe it cannot escape the fundamental constraints unless it is a non ETH implementation? But then it would not have solved the trillema, as our researches (@fpieper and collated by @Markus) show.  These solutions are also subject to the issues outlined below.  Assets - I am uncertain of the status of assets within the L2 territory. Is an asset represented by hashes of its state? But, for anything to happen to that asset, the hash of its state is much like a wrapper for that asset token. How are transaction fees measured in this territory? How are they recorded?  Tax -  This subject should be discussed more since much activity is taxable. If the asset is ETH or ERC20 wrapped then what are the tax implications? Is that wrap action taken by tax authorities in various jurisdictions as a purchase? If it is, how would it be tracked?  Attraction of L2 The most obvious attraction is that L2 is simply there, seeming to grow organically out of the ETH ecosystem. Therefore people will follow along. The more complicated version of this is to do with existing commitment to ETH. There is also the argument that it seems fees will be lower - that in turn detracts from the value of ETH becuase it is burning less gas.  We can also see that people may be attracted to L2 specifically because they think it helps with the sorts of liabilities I’ve mentioned. They may think they are protected within the L2 territory if not across L2 territories. It seems like a complicated and uncertain path to me.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/337269)

    @S --- *"In this technology, the inclusion of a transaction is determined by the participants in that transaction each of whom has a veto. This is orders of magnitude more efficient than proof-of-work or proof-of-stake." Seems like a strange way to define consensus. As if what slows down bitcoin is the fact that not every transaction is multi-sig...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/337194)
