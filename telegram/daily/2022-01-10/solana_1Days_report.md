    @donomanji --- *I think we need to get confirmation that both Codi and p2pb2b are in fact integrating with Solana, as they have been stating that its problems with the Solana integration, which obviously is not good for Solana to be associated if it is not in fact being done* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/897216)

    @g0d007 --- *Hey admin, I have a question about a project build on your system. CODI  They are trying to list on p2pb2b  but they need to integrate the SOL network on P2pb2b first.  Is it that hard to integrate your network ?  And can’t you help them with that 🤷🏼‍♂️ We ( CODI ) investors postponed for the 3th time and p2pb2b keep telling its their fault, but people are getting annoyed and think we got scammed by CODI 🤦🏼‍♂️.

6. **ddos, attacks, network**

    @Zyxter11 --- *I am always talk about that and the developer don't respon to me* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/896828)

    @Robert --- *The network is under DDOS attacks, that's the reason for the slow and problematic transactions in recent times.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/896822)

    @Zyxter11 --- *This answer : - target of attack? No, not an intentional, malicious attack. - how many? Several, because they're not attacks, they're bots spamming IDOs - Whenever there's an NFT drop or an IDO bots spam the launch to try mint/buy as many as possible. Combined with a bug in the codebase that is causing on-chain programs to drop out of cache and require constant recompilation, driving up replay times and pushing out other transactions from being included in blocks - big transactions consumed all available compute resources leaving no space for other transactions, TPS dropped from 2,500-3,000 to 500-1000 as validators prioritized votes to maintain consensus - a fix for the cache thrashing is currently being deployed to mainnet as part of version 1.8.12, so far about 13% of stake have it, the target is for 15% to upgrade today, if things remain stable we'll see further stake upgrading in the coming days, can't yolo changes to mainnet - not a concern for longevity, just growing pains* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/897028)

    @B_sh999 --- *If the issue doesn't about proof of history concept then fixing it should be easy.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/896070)

10. **btc, 28k, 40k**

    @C --- *BTC is at a support of 40k, if it breaks the support of 40K the next support is 28K, in my opinion this is bearmarkt signs, but again a cycle like that never happened that it fell to 3rd.
