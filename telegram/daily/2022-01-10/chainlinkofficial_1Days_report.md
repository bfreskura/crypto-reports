    @r0derik --- *hi all, I'm trying to have a local setup for a contract that uses a chainlink price oracle. I can make it work using hardhat mainnet forking. But at the same time I want to have blocks to automine every 2 seconds, for The Graph integrations. Those two conflict. I would like to try my contract without mainnet forking. But i would need to check some way in my contract if the pricefeed address is not a contract, to use a fixed value. Any idea how I can set this up?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/362261)
