    @Paulus --- *Yes and it auto switch about 25% to DYP. i mean what if we withdraw the DYP, does it affect the share* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238471)

    @Paulus --- *In farming, the % share just base on the asset we farm or include Dyp.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238469)

    @Paulus --- *So the profit base on 75% of what we deposit?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238473)

    @Paulus --- *I know but what the APR for DYP? equal with LP* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238477)

    @Paulus --- *So it may lower than the LP APR then it may not attracting investors, we just wait till the lock time done then move as much as we can from DYP back to LP and keep DYP at minimum. Sound not so good for DYP right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238479)

    @Craig --- *I funded my first DYP farming pool on Oct. 24, 2021. On Dec. 16th I withdrew my funds. The DYP and WETH from my LP was first sent to the contract address, but then, as you can see from the transfers, the WETH was not sent to my wallet, only the DYP. Can anyone shed some light on why I didn't receive my WETH?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238258)
