1. **months, month, 10**

    @Stephan --- *So that means 36*1.658% = ~50% APY that I esentially lose in a year? If I stake for 45% APY, don't I have a loss at the end of the year? Assuming everything stays constant, no price increase, no freezing etc.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162933)

    @EyeBig --- *Hello admin. I have question about staking and freezing. I currently have 10 dfi  If I freeze for 1 month, the expected return with bonus around 29usd.   If I freeze for 60 months, the expected return with bonus around 70usd.  So isn't it better to just freeze for 1 month and auto renew? Or I'm missing something?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162488)

    @EyeBig --- *Estimated return with bonus 1 month - 29 usd 60 months - 70 usd  That's what I got from the website.  So I will get 29 usd after 1 month of freezing or 70 usd after 60 months of freezing. Am I correct?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162506)

    @Stephan --- *How exactly does the freezer calculation work? Seems super odd that the development of capital in DFI takes on a logarithmic function instead of an exponential one. Why would it start saturating after 10 years? Also, an APY of 100% is about 70% APR, yet Freezer's calculations boil down to merely about 100% increase of DFI for the ENTIRE 10 years. Assuming constant APY of 100%, I'd expect 100*(1,7^10) percent increase of capital. Where am I wrong?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162927)

    @Stephan --- *I see, but how come that reduction is so high? I would assume the last year (year 10) to yield most rewards, yet one basically makes no rewards in the calculation of the freezer for the last year.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162931)

    @Razali --- *Your 10.7663579 DFI will become 11.1 DFI after freezing for a month..   Your 10.7663579 DFI will become 28.2 DFI after freezing for 60 months..   Perhaps that might be clearer..?   Also, the calculator takes into account the decreasing rewards.. so it takes into account a larger decrease in rewards when u calculate for 60 months than when u do the 1 month..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162510)

2. **network, defichain, defi**

    @Sahin --- *So if I follow your info. Then for depositing Bitcoin to cake defi from binance. I choose the DFI network. For withdrawing btc to binance i choose the native network and that is BTC network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162808)

    @Sahin --- *Thanks for the chart. I think I get it now. Last example. If I deposit Ethereum from an exchange to cake defi. Then I choose the native network and that is the Ethereum Network. When I move inside the defichain ecosystem than it is dfi network. When I withdraw Ethereum out of cake defi i need to use the native network and that is Ethereum Network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162813)

    @Sahin --- *This is the part where I am stuck. Because on cake for the defichain network it says. 'use this network to send to a defichain wallet'. Kucoin is not a defichain? The only defichain wallet I know is 'defichain wallet' on the Google play store.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162794)

    @James --- *But when you move it out make sure to choose their native blockchain so those tokens can be unwrapped by cake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162807)

    @Kassius84 --- *BTC deposits are still possible and will appear in your Cake wallet.  Only adding to liquidity mining via Cake DeFi or transferring to the DeFiChain network is not possible at the moment.  You can use the BTC in lending, for example.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162377)

    @Kassius84 --- *Sure, you can deposit BTC on Cake DeFi and swap into DFI. Or check other exchanges running an BTC-DFI market. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/defichain/markets/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162545)
