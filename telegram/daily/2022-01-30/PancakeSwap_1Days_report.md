    @Ceddi200 --- *👩‍🏫 There are 2 common requests we see about CAKE.  1) Increase APR 2) Stop all Emissions  👏They👏cannot👏both👏happen.  ———  Q. Where does APR on farms and the CAKE-CAKE Syrup Pools come from? A. From CAKE emissions.   ⚠️If all CAKE emissions were cut to 0, APR would also drop to 0!  The CAKE you earn from the pools and farms are the CAKE that are emitted each block. Emmissions produce APR.  ———  So what are we doing about inflation?  📉We reduce emissions gradually, every month. We've already reduced from 40 to 14.5 CAKE /block.  🔥We burn CAKE every week + add burning mechanisms in new products.  The goal is, and always has been, for more CAKE to leave circulation than enters.  https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2311329)

    @ajj2882 --- *Do you look for the transaction that they are missing?  Do you know how? Just create a new wallet and move things there to be safe and do not log into things you do not know what they are.  Read the addresses very carefully* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2310875)

    @ajj2882 --- *If your wallet is compromised you need a new one.  Surely you are smart enough to understand this.  Do you see the transaction where they were taken?   Keep your old one if you want to chance it, but that would be like living in a house where everyone has a key to come in and you refusing to change the locks then wondering why things were stolen later.  Use some common sense.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2310882)
