3. **did, bitfinex, money**

    @MoneroPal --- *Have you been living under a rock? Daniele is in person with this guy in Dubai. They collaborated on this project and dumped on investors from day 1. They did this by getting their 5% of free time as salary, per the whitepaper, wrapped it into wMEMO, then borrowed MIM against wMEMO on Abra, then dumped this into fiat via USDT. This was the “lick” the robbery, this allowed them to exit without moving price and maintaining that they too got liquidated when it did, but they received the token for free, the investors did not...  Daniele is linked to known Italian money launders, he has a company in Switzerland where the person was a director, the person was convicted and is serving prison time.   Sifu is a gigacriminal, the entire Wonderland, Abra, Popsicle team is non-doxxed outside of Dani and now Sifu, they’re all Bitfinex employees, 0xMerlin has been uncovered to be the CFO of Bitfinex* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721393)

    @MoneroPal --- *Nothing is alleged, it’s proven. Dani is also proven to have been a director on a Swiss company for Zulu Republic his bogus KYC blockchain project from 2016 with a now convicted money launderer for the Italian mob. Futhermore, there is a lot of evidence that points to 0xMerlin being the CFO of Bitfinex. This is not proven, but it’s pretty plausible. The other details were all uncovered and proven with facts such as conversations with Dani, corporate records, and court cases. You sound like a frog sympathizer…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721588)

    @MoneroPal --- *100% US prosecutors will go after Daniele and he will be extradicted from Dubai to New York to face crimianal charges for running an unregulated investment fund that targeted American Citizens and fradulently claimed it was managed by a financial professional with prior asset managmenet experience. Not to mention the connection to money laundering, Bitfinex, and faux investments such as Betswap to continue to maintain a positive image for the purpose of exit liquidity.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721417)
