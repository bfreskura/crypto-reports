    @JoeyDieleman --- *This has to do with cloudflare not trusting the vpn its ip address* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329739)

    @Madsumo --- *Hi.  Recently my laptop was compromised and so I rebuilt it from the bottom up, i.e. complete reinstall from the OS up.  I have then set all apps where possible to 2FA and installed Norton360 plus their SecureVPN service.  On startup, with the VPN enabled, I can still access all my apps, exchanges, and wallets but I cannot access the DEXTools App. I get an error stating your site has security to stop security attacks. If I stop the VPN, connect to your site first, and then restart the VPN, it is fine.  I believe this is then bypassing my VPN as the session was started without it enabled.  I am not a security expert but is there anything I can do so I do not have to stop and re-enable the VPN?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329736)

    @napascual --- *Maybe try with different countries then uk/us as well, check that the ip comes from a trusted ASN* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329752)

    @napascual --- *I remember a user that had norton 360 vpn service using non trusted ASNs. I encourage you to use a different vpn provider* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329750)

    @JoeyDieleman --- *You could try, if the vpn supports, to connect to another node/country or try another vpn service* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329740)
