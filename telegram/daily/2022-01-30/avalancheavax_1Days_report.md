3. **fantom, mnemonic, key**

    @Alp --- *I am really afraiding to ask question. Lots of scammers are calling me. I am not beginner. Just wondering that i can access to avax wallet with my Fantom mnemomic key. It is normal?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325131)

    @Alp --- *If Fantom and Avax generate the same mnemomic keys what will happen? I can enter avax wallet with Fantom key. I can send Avax to this wallet. It is strange for me. Maybe somebody has the same wallet. I didnt generate it. Just restore it with Fantom key.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325157)

    @Nicolas_A --- *You generated it when you used Fantom. The probability of someone generating the same key as you is close to 0* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325158)

    @CypherBlock --- *A mnemonic is just a bunch of words used to generate keys from. So yes you can in theory use a mnemonic from another blockchain as long as word list and number of words is compatible, but you won't see any funds there of course if you haven't used that mnemonic on that particular chain before. So Alp does that explain things?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325149)

    @Alp --- *No funds at Avax wallet. Bu in the Fantom wallet there is 1 Fantom.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325145)
