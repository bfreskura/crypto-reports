    @adriel829 --- *Crypto is volatile and you normally see people making 1000%, 10000%  or even more in a particular project.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/28640)

2. **big, dca fine, volumes**

    @sariabdul --- *I think this correction will have a larger window than May-Aug 21 crash. The current macro economic indicators are not favourable and crypto is just part of that.  Also the volumes are terribly low and until we see the volumes pick up, to either a big red candle, or a big green candle, it will be crabbing between $35k-$38k for a while.  So DCA now is fine. But don’t go all in.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/28736)

    @Cryptokid91 --- *Patience with buying     This, this is my struggle. DCA is all fine and dandy, but then price goes down and ... yeah* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/28735)

    @yozhai06 --- *But it's a good idea to ALWAYS DCA out near the top.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/28665)

    @jochill044 --- *It's better to just DCA when it dips* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/28536)

    @gramlyla --- *The best thing to do, in my opinion, is to DCA out just as you do in.  You can’t time the market, so don’t try to.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/28309)

    @opsahl --- *Dca will never do you wrong* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/28539)
