    @Sylvester --- *You should change your investment mind then you manage to not sell the assets you have. You have money that you don't need. You make investment with that money. Let's say you bought BTC and you think the price will increase in long term. If you think the value of the bitcoin will increase then why you would sell. Taking profit is good but then what you are going to do with that money. You should also invest that money to somewhere. If you find a better investment than BTC then go for it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/24763)

Which makes it extremely difficult to people new to the space to evaluate projects.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/24783)
