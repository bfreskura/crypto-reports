    @Lustock --- *Hi, I would like to make a question maybe the admin could help me I bought Fantom in Binance today, the idea was to storage in nano ledger under the ETH’s address but Instead of that I put under Fantom network and Binance allowed me to complete the transaction successfully; but I never received the Fantom in my ETH address after ( I add in advance the token). What can I do?  Thanks a lot* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/644086)

    @Ambiora --- *That's really not good  for Fantom's growth man. We really need this if we want to be a market leader. Fantom has only 50 validator node which makes him not fully decentralized to attract DeFi protocols. We need FVM so that validator node can be increased in order to make Fantom really big. We had heard about FVM in 2018 but since then we are waiting for the same. And still there is not promising date. Hope you can convey these concerns to Andre Cronje* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/644413)
