1. **dfi, reward, apy**

    @Griffithchandar --- *pairs i had 1 month ago slowly transited to full defi* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169847)

    @CPT Cool --- *What's wrong with pump and dump. Your sorhai hosp encourage people to arbitrage anyway* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169785)

    @xavier_pwm --- *Hi everyone, would like to ask how do the rewards are determined backend. It seems that the estimated APY and actual reward payout is different by about 30%. In my case, I did a 10 year freezing, hoping to get the indicated 90+% apy return, only to be receiving about 30% less. Any advice?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169438)

    @YyeapY --- *does the apy% shown at LM/Staking is excluded reward fee?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169422)

    @Emonkhan05 --- *I pass 180 Days  I have 26.14 Dfi in my account  So I going to unstake My all Dfi I only unstake 5 Dfi 20.66 Dfi Frozen why sir?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169831)

    @zachgax --- *Let’s have a feature discussion.   Personally, It triggers my inner OCD the longer I use the product, the more fractional entries I have in the freezer. Especially with promos and bonuses like now. Would be great if there were some updates to enhance the Freezer functionality.   1. Batch extension and entry consolidation.   I understand that a new entry has to be made when we freeze because duration is calculated at time of entry. But, if I were to extend an entry, it recalculates duration at time of extension right? So, if I can batch extend multiple Freezer entries and consolidate them into one, it would make my freezer so much neater.  2. Auto batch freezing as a sub-function for auto-staking.   Right now, I manually freeze my auto-staked rewards when it reaches a certain size. I think this would be a great to have something like a submenu to auto-staking where I can set Auto-freeze of staked DFI when it reaches a set amount. Say every 50 DFI.   What do you guys think?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169432)

    @DmgBautista --- *Your country is accepted by the current singaporean rules. I would double check on the number you gave, maybe the international code is incorrect?  If really is all good, I would submit a support ticket explaining the situation.

4. **swap, fees, transfer**

    @Christian Horn - --- *Hey Guys, one simple question... Yesterday I was about to buy some BTC in the CakeDefi platform and since I wanted to do a monet transfer from my account, the Company I had to give the money to was this one. However, when I did the transfer the Bank warned me it could be a Spam so I just cancel it. I don't think it is a spam but well I prefer to ask here first before completing the operation.   Also, what have less interest when buying... using the Credit Card or the Transfer between banks ?   Thanks :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169690)

    @Tim --- *Hi Michael, is there a way to swap LTE to USDC on Cake?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169699)

    @Tim --- *Thanks.. I’m just wondering how you arbitrage the LTC-DFI to USDC-DFI pools on the DEX?? Do you also need to include a CEX?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169702)

    @Goracasta --- *What is cheapest way to swap defi back to btc/usdt/doge/xlm ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169802)

    @weng --- *Transfer from cake to dex takes forever.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169826)

    @Kassius84 --- *If you swap via DeFiChain DEX, you have to go back via Cake DeFi to unwrap the dTokens in "normal" Coins. Withdrawl fee to wallet, Swap fees, network fee to Cake DeFi and than withdrawl fee to final wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169809)

5. **cake defi, log, consider**

    @DmgBautista --- *It's not on the list of approved documents, but thus, is an officialy government issued document, so it could work. Only Cake support will be able to answer that. You can contact them in the below link  https://cake.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169517)

    @DmgBautista --- *Honestly, I would only trust in the official partners that appear in the Cakedefi partners list when you try in the website or app. If any other existed, Cake would have made a statement on it. My bank never had any issue with Cake official partners, if your bank has made that statement, I would consider that an alert signal.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169729)

    @DmgBautista --- *Hi! What do you mean? You should had received one. Are you sure the phone number you gave at Cake is ok?  Also, please consider the country in which you are. Is it a country in which Cake can provide its services? (I don't know if it could be a reason, but please consider it)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169527)
