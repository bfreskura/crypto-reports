    @duckdegen --- *I really dont understand why binance keeps listing stablecoins. The previous one they listed it went up 100x which tells me that they dont have enough liquidity and that they frankly dont care about keeping stablecoins stable. Even these stablecoin listings pumped.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310548)

    @Milan_ZIL --- *Its also interesting why some metas keep getting revived, until they dont* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310704)

4. **evm, l2s, ethereum**

    @yic_alex --- *L1s are competing with Ethereum L2s imho. At least they're selling the same qualities to the end user. I don't think Ethereum can be beaten from an ecosystem / network effect / security POV realistically any time soon.  Ethereum L2s mostly have been building in the background, some don't even have tokens. It will be interesting to see what happens once the marketing is turned up for those.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310689)

    @Suk4b1y4t --- *Only EVM L1s are competing with ETH L2s* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310693)

    @Hullow --- *The argument is shifting now. Solana proponents are now claiming their L1 is more scalable AND decentralized than Ethereum (+ its L2s). Same narrative emerging from Avalanche community. You’re also seeing attacks on the lack of decentralization of ETH L2s (token distribution, node count etc.)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310690)

    @Hullow --- *It’s a narrative fight. Alt-L1 proponents claim they are in a battle against Ethereum, whereas Ethereum proponents claim it’s all about scaling, and that its L2s are the answer* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310688)

    @Suk4b1y4t --- *Why aren't you convinced of that? The only reason for anyone to use anything EVM which isn't eth is gas fees or speed of confirmation, there are no further innovations that I have seen. Hence they are all competitors with one another directly for developer and user activity based on EVM.  Non evm chains are attempting to move away from or improve upon what EVM is, and are not competing over EVM devs, and are in a different niche which consists of features or functionalities that perhaps aren't supported on EVM or solidity and thereby aren't exactly competitors.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310705)

    @cragslist --- *Sol and Avax stole a lot of market share from ETH but I think 2.0 will steal the show when it comes* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310694)

5. **airdrop, nft, opensea**

    @banteg --- *is there any project behind sos or is it just an airdrop?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310500)

    @SpikeSpiege1 --- *Sold mine as well. It has no affiliation to opensea what so ever. Just pumped by CT in order to salvage a little money from all the illiquid NFT bags they're holding.  Sad part even at this mc the airdrop didn't cover their gas from nft trading lol* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310543)

    @wilflare --- *it feels like an airdrop just to thank early supporters of the NFT community (who use OpenSea) - but their "early" is a snapshot taken a few days ago  there's a Discord and it seems like they are shaping it to be DAO to support folks rekted by rugpulls, etc.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310505)

    @whiterun --- *how opendao airdrop works? i see it doesn't use merkle proof.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310488)

    @rohan_pandit --- *anyone have that airdrop selling meme handy where the guy gets more depressed as the price goes up?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310532)

    @samd0000 --- *Idk mine is too small to be even able to sell lol* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310503)
