    @nfwaple --- *nothing, because the price is made up of OHM price x current index, and current index goes up only. If gOHM price stays the same, it means OHM price has gone down* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134995)

    @Dr. --- *Can there be a Python API so that I can embed this price of OHM and the current index at the same time so that I can build my own monitor app?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134958)

    @Samuil86 --- *@nfwaple can't figure out how to profit from owning gOHM? I migrated to it 10 days ago. Now the quantity is the same, the price is about the same.

8. **sohm, gohm, migrate**

    @nfwaple --- *ok, I don't know it is pretty straightforward to me, just like before when you buy OHM and stake for sOHM, the only tricky thing of the migration is people not understanding how gOHM works* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/133940)
