2. **algorand, projects, ecosystem**

    @Atbash1984 --- *Excuse me, I tried to ask if anyone can give me a piece of advice about what to study to be able to run an Algorand node. I linked the official link about the guide. I am asking about the basis. I am a young smart guy, i know how to deal with defi but I have no knowledge about programming.. thanks!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325803)

    @BBeniek --- *But what else? There are many interesting projects with their own coin on Algorand* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325703)

    @pictonz8 --- *algorand was on the radar before this - it's looking very good so far!  Iso 20022, eco friendly and all that, checks all the boxes.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326089)

    @Tiny_Philosopher_784 --- *Cost will become most important soon.   Yes, free tx coins are gonna catch interest, but they'll have to start with excessive amounts of coins. Or they have to burn alot and mint more, which means it can be rugged easily.  With algorand, that's not the concept. It's a nice little loop. Some algos have been lost already, and it will only continue to become less over time. So as much as people harp on the tokenomics, they don't see the future reductions that will invariably occur.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326257)
