1. **favorites, chart, left**

    @Simon --- *Guys not sure I’m a fan of the new layout, basically I want to be able to see my favourites so I can track current prices of my investments and a single chart together. I don’t care about anything else. All the guff on the left with pool info, dext score etc is fixed when I rarely care about any of it, it reduces the space for the chart and my favourites now have to float on top of it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317457)

    @Simon --- *I still think being able to hide the stuff on the left would be good so I can have the chart and trade history spanning the rest of the width* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/318245)

    @Bralna --- *To give an idea of what this looks like for me: 1) all the stuff on the left I only need to see occasionally yet it’s fixed. 2) chart is now much smaller and obscured by favourites 3) favourites are now less compact so I have to scroll vertically to see them all 4) trade history table really difficult to view and I have to scroll horizontally now* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317559)

    @hopiumvictim --- *Who in the right mind would want to redesign the "favorites" section* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317949)

    @fiesta_0604 --- *Could I ask something relate to the BOTS? How can I stop users using BOT to call for a chart? There are no helps command show me that.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316592)

    @atosm --- *same as this guy. is there a way to put the graph on the left side. wayyyy tooo much info that I don't really want.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317106)

2. **token, tokens, old token**

    @FredericDEXT --- *Same as before , at token info tab* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/318154)

    @solidask --- *Hello, is it possible to remove old version (V1) chart of a token that migrated to new version (V2)?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316912)

    @Kian_hashemi --- *Because everyone who trades has valuable seconds to check the tokens on the favorite list.  We had access to the previous version very quickly, but now we have to click a few times to be informed about the status of the tokens.  This is very bad for the trader.  I hope users think fast before their numbers dwindle.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317746)

    @D --- *nice work making the old token available after making a new one* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317036)

    @spfr237 --- *u guys want old UI back because you are too lazy to study new one!😂 common step out of your comfort zone and try to learn it, i bet it worth it, cause there are things that can be done with this UI which was impossible with old one😉* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317542)

    @scottcrypto11 --- *hi guys have we received our monthly allocation in numbers yet it is overdue now* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316715)

    @napascual --- *Your could send more and the remaining will be linked to your account, but the DEXT need is calculated at the moment in renewing it (DEXT price at that moment)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317360)

    @rpoole69 --- *Thanks, do I just need to hold 1000 DEXT in my wallet to have a subscription or do I need to do what the user account page states "Transfer 224 DEXT from your current account to the following account" ? Because the main website says one thing, user configuration in the dAPP says another* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316547)

    @napascual --- *Yeah monthly, read message above, it's ok to send more that the monthly need, but you have to take what I explained into account* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317368)

    @MYHOMECOIN --- *How can i make sure that's admin? as theirs no admin on top!?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317077)

7. **dextools, dex, new**

    @FredericDEXT --- *This is the first step to make a more complete and modern UI, but many things are still in progress, and the community feedback is the best way to improve and the guide we always followed at dextools since the beginning.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317317)

    @Chris --- *Any way to revert to the old DexTools?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317101)

    @darkstorns --- *I haven't seen a significant change in functionality yet, this is not an update but an idle.  The number showing the price is too small, need blue red as before to know the price movement, I think the dev is imitating some other dex site, while dextools is number 1, who else needs to be imitated?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317980)

    @bastardganpunk --- *Dextools released the new redesign 😊* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317933)

    @Sad --- *The new dextools environment has become very difficult ... it is difficult to work with* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317453)
