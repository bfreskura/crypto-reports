    @nfwaple --- *buy gOHM and do nothing, or buy OHM v2 and stake them, they both have the same outcome* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/132805)

    @DeFiMaximalist --- *not for me but the staking does https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/stake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/131658)

    @ADIL --- *So just buy gohm directly and no need to stake ? Auto staking??* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/132646)

    @nfwaple --- *Did you see the second pic of the thread: https://twitter.com/dopex_intern/status/1473439395999068162/photo/1  If you only own gOHM, the sOHM you see in the Staking page is just an equivalent amount of sOHM you'd get when you unwrap your gOHM, you don't actually own gOHM + sOHM. gOHM is already doing something, it has the same outcome as staking OHM.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/132819)

    @Talal107 --- *I haven't migrated yet as I saw many people were having issues so I decided to do it like 2 weeks from now.

    @Stu --- *Does this mean the index on the app is different for each person? If I have held gohm for 1 week and someone else has only held for 1 day then the value must be different on each app? Am I correct?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/131842)

    @hunkarperk --- *Is the current index for gohm diffirent for everybody? A person who entered staking with gohm couple months ago, this person's index should be higher than new stakers. Am i correct?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/132803)

    @nfwaple --- *yes having gOHM in your wallet is equivalent to staking OHM, you get the same outcome. gOHM price = OHM price x current index, the index goes up every rebase* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/132796)
