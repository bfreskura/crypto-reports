    @Aaron --- *africa maybe, it will rise them up with smart contracts and stabilize their currencys with less economic damage like inflation , united emirates countries too, they are against the usd domination and their influences, and the oil in some years will not be so lucrative anymore.. i guess in africa and some countries in asia like afghanistan and pakistan, in arabic community dubai absolutely will dominate most partly of the coins* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/14130)

    @Baker --- *The U.S. will be last because they will try to make as much money on regulation as possible.
