6. **10, 013, swift**

    @xlmshark --- *0.013 per xrp, no worth it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3027499)

    @mattgeez --- *However, since there are 50bil xrp tokens circulating and only 100mil solo tokens for xrp holders…do the math…1xrp = 0.013 solo. Hold 1 solo = 1.5 solo* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3027178)

    @pdogg123 --- *Incorrect get your facts out before you post fud.    Swift currently runs  $1.2 quadrillion a year    If XRP captures 10% of the swift system which is more than likely they will that put xrp at $1,200 a token/coin.    If xrp captures the entire swift system after time that would put each toke at $12,000 per token.     That’s based on $100 billion circulating supply* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3028165)

    @erik_sz91 --- *Of I won't post it then. Basicly he said if XRP manages 10% of Swift volume it would be 4 digits. I really don't know enough to say if that could be possible or not, I just hear others opinions :P* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3027000)

    @cmahrz --- *Depends on the price of XRP and your standard of living. You have no clue if this will top at $10, $1,000, or $10,000.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3028033)
