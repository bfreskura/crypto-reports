4. **vrf, chainlink, chainlink vrf**

    @leozhezha --- *As the VRF stands for Verifiable Random Function you are easily able to understand from the name the functionality.   We decided to utilize this feature into our Win platform, a lottery game platform where we are randomly generating the winning numbers. Every 12 hours we are given the opportunity to win a big price.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356975)

    @marcromeron --- *In just a few moments, we will have a Community Q&A with 1000 BLOCKS who recently announced that integrates Chainlink VRF to help power transparent rewards distribution.    To read more about this integration, please check this article below:  https://1000blocks.medium.com/1000blocks-space-integrates-chainlink-vrf-to-help-power-transparent-rewards-distribution-bcbf02908911* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356733)

    @leozhezha --- *There are some great features of the Chainlink VRF that makes it important on the blockchain.   Some of them in my opinion are the following:   1. It regulates the process of Random Number Generation for the smart contracts.  2. Produces honest randomness for the game outcome.  3. Consuming smart contracts get all the random number results after they are verified.  4. Oracles cannot manipulate the result generated.  5. Providing users the integrity of the game along with the cryptographic proof, which builds a trust level.  6. VRF does not allow the malicious users and the node operators to alter and tamper with the randomness results.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356971)

    @jakelabsgroup --- *Both works! Both of our platforms provides an easy starting point for blockchain and real estates aficinados, with the former one allowing investors to grow their wealth with real estate with just 100 USDT, and have a little fun with our WIN platform winning rewards.

    @jakelabsgroup --- *Whoa - that's a great question. The WIN platform is part of our ecosystem to create more utilities to our LABS token.

It is also a perfect starting point for members to start their blockchain investment journey.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356977)

    @jakelabsgroup --- *LABS has been focusing on digital Real Estate investment. The WIN Platform is an innovative and revolutionary idea to give back to the LABS supporters. With just $5 USD worth of LABS, participants can enter the raffle and try their luck.  The payoff of the winning ticket varies each day. Each sold ticket increases the prize pool. When a prize pool isn't won, the next round's prize pool will be accumulated from the previous round; the longer it's been since someone has won the jackpot, the larger the prize pool will be.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356964)

    @jakelabsgroup --- *Sure thing! LABS Group is a digital investment platform that provides access to fractionalized property ownership and enables the continuous trading of real estate assets-backed tokenized shares on a regulated security exchange.  We use blockchain technology and smart contracts to ensure complete transparency over a borderless ecosystem where property developers and investors can interact seamlessly and with unprecedented efficiency. So that people could invest in real estate projects in a fraction of its price point. Making real estate investment available for everyone.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356960)
