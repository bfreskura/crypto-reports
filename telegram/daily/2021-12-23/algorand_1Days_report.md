1. **stable, currency, use**

    @Ninvel --- *Well, thank you very much for answering me, but my interest is precisely not to use a stablecoin but rather that the native currency itself is stable, it just seems that in this algorand it does not fulfill my needs.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324888)

    @Ninvel --- *I do not know if I explain myself well but the stability of a currency is a purely economic concept and is measured with the generalized changes in prices of products and services (inflation and deflation) the dollar is stable because its inflation is very small* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324883)

    @Martin --- *Life is not stable man. Everything changes except change. Your super stable-neutral coin is a honorable idea but that’s impossible to achieve in the real world.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324902)

    @Ninvel --- *Hello, how are you? I am a junior developer of JAVA, I have got a project, the project was in tezos but I have another phiilosophy than the tezos comunity, my project is create a wallet for entreprises based in blockchains, this wallet would be desinged to be comfortable to use for physical and online stores, the problem with the tezos community is that my phylosophy is based on the international use of a “neutral” token (native token)  which must be stable (as a stablecoin but without being linked with another coin) Is the algo token designed to be long-term stable for use in international trade? thanks for the answer 😄* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324855)

    @Ninvel --- *If a pizza is worth 1 algo in 5 years, how much will the pizza be worth? that's the metric* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324879)

    @Ninvel --- *If the production method of the pizza has not changed (it costs the same effort to produce it) the pizza should be worth 1 algo, if not, the currency is not stable, this is how the stability of currencies has always been measured* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324881)

4. **governance, rewards, algo**

    @reslimed --- *It's actually being replaced by liquidity rewards for staking in dex pools. Governance is separate* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324945)

    @Marco_Fonseca --- *Hi everyone. I've committed X Algos for the 1st voting session and have kept a min. of that amount in my Algorand wallet. In parallel I've been using Yieldly to stake anything above my committed Algos. The trouble is that Yieldly allows for all my ALGO to be staked (committed + surplus) but I suppose if I do that I'll lose my 1st governance rewards as the period hasn't ended yet. Do I have to keep the amount of ALGOS in my algorand wallet until end of 31Dec for governance rewards? Anyone knows how much %yield you get from governance?  Thank you in advance :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325062)

    @Chocoim --- *Nevwe dare to compare algo to eth and btc Algo is chain with billions of coins created out of thin air and slow development controlled by few people at top . Btc and eth having thousands of running on it.. r decentralied chain... had to put lof of effort and energy to create them...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324670)

    @Tiny_Philosopher_784 --- *I have will forever continue to dare and compare the two. Just to spite your troll self.  Btc is run by China miners, same with ethereum.  Now, for your nonsense... you don't really dig around or understand what's come online for algorand, but that's okay. Just sell your algo and go back to ethereum. Just do it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324673)

6. **tps, cbdc, upgrade**

    @S --- *Can we get an official update to the proton upgrade roadmap? Clearly the 202146k tps and then 2021 10k tps upgrades haven’t happened on the timelines stated by Algorand Inc, and unfortunately this is creating a good amount of consternation within the community. I understand the refocus on stateproofs, which is great, but we need a refresh on upgrade timelines so Algorand doesn’t needlessly lose credibility.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324809)
