1. **staking, stake, staked**

    @Basti --- *Thing with iota staking is... It's no real staking.. So there will be a flood of unstaked tokens once the 90 days are over :D* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301725)

    @sobroggi --- *I think early participants is actually the VCs etc. participating in ecosystem funding, but not participants of staking... https://blog.assembly.sc/assembly-fair-launch-token-distribution/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301735)

    @ash1taka1997 --- *Yes. In fact your IOTAs will never leave your wallet, staking is a transaction to your own wallet that has a "staked" mark on it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/300849)

    @Tahmis --- *Well this was actually anticipated that something like this would happen when the actual staking starting is announced as everyone wants to withdraw at the same time* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301465)

    @Tahmis --- *I recommend waiting for Binance to open withdrawals. Huobi doesn't work either* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301252)

7. **withdrawals, open withdrawals, create pressure**

    @Tahmis --- *Everyone is withdrawing I guess and it causes problems unfortunately* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301076)

    @cryptoadvisoryaus --- *I had a friend in Australia try CoinSpot today and he said that’s also now suspended for withdrawal?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301072)

    @Tahmis --- *etoro is not allowing withdrawals unfortunately. You should ask their support if they are going to* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301766)

    @sy-subrc --- *Check if they allow withdrawals first* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301243)

    @sy-subrc --- *Wouldn’t be aware, that they restricted withdrawals* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301133)

    @Tahmis --- *Please all contact you exchanges support to create some pressure for them to open the withdrawals! Also it might help to create some pressure on social media ;)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301031)

8. **bep20, iota, binance**

    @sy-subrc --- *BEP20 IOTA are not "real" IOTA, but wrapped tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. You simply cannot stake them. Period. You have to swap them first.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301283)

    @navinhn --- *Yes , that s 1 option, but if IOTA need thr token holders to participate then they also should support right , now major exchange like binance , huobi, Bittrex are not allowing them what the use, so what firefly can do from thr end is then can support BEP20 chain , if they don’t support others then how others will support thr token , in future if they want to transfer Bak to exchange to sell then again it’s going to create a problem,* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301591)

    @navinhn --- *No , I m not choosing BEP20 in first place , but Binance has only BEP20 to transfer out of binance, and they suspended Real IOTA , if they don’t support then most of IOTA will b stuck on exchange* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301536)

    @sy-subrc --- *Just because you chose BEP20 in the first place, instead of „real IOTA“ is not a valid reason.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301490)

    @navinhn --- *If firefly support accepting BEP20 then it’s not a problem, because binance has opened withdrawal for IOTA in BEP20 , if IOTA want thr users to stake then they should enable this , else all binance IOTA coins will b stuck thr only* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301470)

    @navinhn --- *Nope, when you have two doors to enter house , and one door is suspended and another door is locked from inside , so we are asking them to open it from inside so that we can enter with another door,  so here two doors are IOTA and BEP20 network, hope if you are technically understand the concept then u will understand,* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301618)

9. **bitfinex, withdraw bitfinex, withdrawal**

    @Snelting11 --- *My Bitfinex withdrawal now 13 hour pending since this morning* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301329)

    @sy-subrc --- *So it's more a specific problem to your account and not a general Bitfinexx issue* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301357)

    @Lord_Hermes6 --- *i withdraw from bitfinex its work fine .* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301600)

    @Makimako --- *Nop you can withdraw in Bitfinex* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301474)

    @sy-subrc --- *Bitfinex definitely works. Tried it 5 minutes ago, withdrawal received just now* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301341)

    @khthon --- *The thing about Bitfinex, I believe, is that you cannot check anything about a withdrawal without having the respective token. That is, you cannot check networks, or fees, or if it is enabled or suspended...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301135)
