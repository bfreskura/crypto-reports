    @NotTheGodfather --- *republicans are red, democrats are blue. combine the two colors and you get the color of purple, the color of royalty. the Elites own both sides. Republicans are the york rite of masons, Dems are the scottish rite. Two wings of same bird.  thats why political arguments along party lines are a waste of time. Back to crypto!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/711088)

    @MoneroPal --- *No tax authority currently is analyzing the chain, certaintly not the IRS. They audit a total of 4500 partnerships per year and have been consistently defunded the past 15+ years. Not to mention the overhead and inability to prove wallet ownership reliably is still a major blocker. It will happen eventually, but not anytime soon. Many wallets, such as BlueWallet generate a new wallet address each transaction. Treat crypto as an asset, pay taxes when you sell that asset into fiat.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/710987)

    @MoneroPal --- *Coinbase does not report, unless it is sold into fiat and you’re issued a 1099-misc if you’re an Americuck. No reason to use Coinbase for anything except on and off ramping.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/710994)
