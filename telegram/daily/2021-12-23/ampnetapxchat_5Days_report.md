    @KonradCapital --- *Tokenized real world assets is a very new concept and will take trial and error to be done correctly. But I know @mislavjavor won’t give up so it’s just a matter of time before AMPNET gets it right. Like I said before I would recommend they make a platform and that platform provides all the services needed for tokenizing and investing in tokenized real world assets* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35797)
