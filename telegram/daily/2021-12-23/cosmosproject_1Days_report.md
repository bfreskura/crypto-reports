    @Joshycrypto --- *it keep saying something about a netwrok update ... how long does it take for real man ... your costing me money* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457652)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Vega upgrade was completed on cosmos hub almost 9 days ago. You should contact to binance and ask them.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457920)

    @Cordtus --- *Pretty much any exchange you can think of. Including a few dex on ibc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/458667)

    @AtomJazz --- *Network was upgraded a week ago already. I thought you read the pinned message 😀* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/458483)

    @Cordtus --- *Depends on the exchange and what tokens they accept* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/458226)

2. **osmosis, iris, swap**

    @AtomJazz --- *You can withdraw IRIS from Binance to Keplr and swap it to atom on Osmosis DeX* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/458542)

    @Ivan --- *I mean, an option I don't have to send back to an exchange. How about osmosis? But I cant figure out how to get my secret over there either? 🤔* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457868)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Osmosis has their own validator set to secure themself. I don’t think they will need to use interchain security. But as you aware, osmosis delegators can decide to use interchain security or not via governance proposal.    But technically I don’t know if you can use your own validator set and use interchain security is an option! This question should be directed to devs.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/458915)

    @Cordtus --- *You can swap the atom on binance for SCRT and send that to your keplr SCRT address, then send it to osmosis and swap it back for atom.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/458654)

    @Paesch --- *Very nice  Do you also know how Safe osmosis is in terms of hacking? I read all the time that Amm‘s get hacked and I’m a bit unsure bc of it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457958)

    @Cordtus --- *Yes or you can swap via osmosis to another token* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/458222)

    @OS4UU --- *Could you please expand this info a little, what do you mean with "here not a single chain"? Sorrt i want to understand correctly, thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457609)

    @OS4UU --- *What is the Tx speed for Cosmos Blockchain? How many per second?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457598)

    @AtomJazz --- *Hey there! Interoperability allows horizontal scalability. Instead of trying to run many dAPPs on one single chain, Cosmos allows to run infinite numbers of application specific blockchains. In Cosmos we have specialized AMM chains, smart contract chains, defi chains, privacy chains, gaming chains all able to intercommunicate and exchange data.  https://mapofzones.com/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/458169)

    @AtomJazz --- *Those are just wrapped token solutions from those projects. Not related with Cosmos at all. We don't suggest using it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/457637)
