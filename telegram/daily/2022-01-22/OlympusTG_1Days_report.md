6. **btc, bitcoin, market**

    @Cixex --- *BTC support has been broken. Kiss bull run a good bye* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/162998)

    @malmsta --- *Dont listen too much to the doom and gloomers because it doesn't matter... So what if btc drops to 12k. it isn't going to stay there... It will go up again. The only variable that has changed is time. There is a delay. My experience with people who call the apocalypse is that they just want to sound smart... If they are positive then they are just considered naïve so better to be negative about it, then you won't look so dumb... You'll be fine...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/163566)

    @brucoo --- *You know what happens... This is worse than when btc crash 60k to 30k. At least from my point of view. The thing is a new people enter at the market in bull run... (Anyway not only cryptos are going down)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/164699)

    @Ahmad --- *If Bitcoin go to 10k, ppl will go bonkers.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/164261)

    @Valihora --- *It's hard to say now. I believe BTC is still a good value saver, but now the situation can be even worse. S&P and other indexes did big dump today, so BTC has followed. And I hope it's not just a beginning of bear market...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/163563)

    @Sammysnail --- *Ye like he controls the price ......market shit at the moment so everyone has panic sold causkngbthe price to drop more !! I'm expecting more pain afte btc confirms a weekly bear market trend* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/164654)

    @nfwaple --- *yes gOHM is index adjusted, OHM is not* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/164956)

    @CryptoAlex1 --- *Isn't it the same since you can just wrack ohm to gohm?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/164953)

    @nfwaple --- *does it matter if OHM is $1 but gOHM is $10k?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/164191)
