1. **dfi, rewards, lm**

    @Stephan --- *Thanks for the answer, but in that case I would have to add all up right? I meant to have an Overview like on the main page where I can see how many DFI I have earned in the last week/month etc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167270)

    @Stephan --- *That makes sense, so receiving less DFI as reward does not correlate with actual Dollar price of DFI, but rather with how many ppl are in the LM pool correct?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166971)

    @rhodium219 --- *Thanks, I'm aware of that and I seldom bother to look at the estimate APR as this is indeed an estimate. I'm asking from experience, what has changed since last week that would cause a 10% reduction in the LM rewards? Do you know? Can I find out? For example it could be that we now have 10% more investment in the LM pool. Which would be great. It could be that the LM rewards have been reduced because they have been diverted to other schemes. I was just interested in understanding what has happened so I can manage my own expectations.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167002)

    @Nazhadi57 --- *May I know what the LP mining reward APRs depend on? Token prices? Or liquidity volume* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166902)

    @Stephan --- *Is there any possiblity to see how much DFI one has earned? (not USD)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167263)

    @Nazhadi57 --- *LM APRs keep doing down and down.. based on past experience, how long can they go? Need evaluate if it’s worth staking the LPs if the rewards are too low* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167257)

    @DmgBautista --- *That's strange. Never heard that from any user, if there was any problem with the IOS app, more than garanteed that half of the telegram group would have been making quite a fuss on that. Maybe some update that went less well? I am sorry, but if you could not use the app since like forever, that is really strange, and to my best knowledge, quite unique 😕* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166894)

6. **dtokens, dusd, swap**

    @Dorian R. 1204 --- *The thing i can’t even select the dtoken from the drop down menu when i click on swap* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166832)

    @Dorian R. 1204 --- *Can you try from dtesla to dusd?you will see that dtokens are not part of the currencies available in the drop down menu. @DmgBautista* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166846)

    @DmgBautista --- *You need to change the dtokens into dusd first, ir you want to swap them for a different dtoken. Dtokens are created through dusd, so you need to make that conversion, a direct route that does that in the background is not yet implemented. Maybe it can eventually exist, but for now, you must go the full route* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166830)

    @Dorian R. 1204 --- *Yeah i thought i could do that but i am not offered the option to swap from dtokens to other. Maybe because i am using the phone app. Will try on the website* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166829)

    @Dorian R. 1204 --- *Hi, how do i sell/swap my dtokens (e.g. Tesla) ? Thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166826)

    @Dorian R. 1204 --- *Thanks for looking into it. I really hope the team can work on that quickly. This is a big deal if we can’t sell our dtokens...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166857)
