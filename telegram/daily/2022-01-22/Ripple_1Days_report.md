1. **xrp, wallet, long**

    @CasperLayer1 --- *So i called the months long downtrend november. Then i called the 58k down, after that the 44k down(a bit later then thought). I called the drop for xrp top 68 when we were 1,10 and told to sell and buy back  So till now got every one right even though people calling me fudder Just because i made the observation that xrp price is shit and behaving like shit. We are like 1600 days! without ATH.  So whats next? As i said after Breaking 44k down which  i said was certain coming in like 2 weeks i would take another look.  Wellllll here it Comes! Were ruined! Bear market 100 procent no Breaking 1.00 this year. Or 50k btc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3043467)
