    @JC --- *Whats the price target for FANTOM* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/638108)

    @RYTHM_ISMYGOAL --- *I seek to learn, not to compare and contrast. My question has no bad meaning. The question I have is that the Fantom ecosystem can very easily support DEFI projects that work on the Ethereum, but we see that in this time the acceptance of the Fantom ecosystem is very slow, while it is both faster and more cost-effective. Well, the reason is that the use of these new ecosystems, which are much faster and more economical than previous ecosystems, is slow. Is it lack of credibility and security? 🙏🙏🙏* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/637822)
