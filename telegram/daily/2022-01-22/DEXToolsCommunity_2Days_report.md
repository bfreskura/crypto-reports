    @rpoole69 --- *Good morning, yesterday I had asked about a screen which showed all transactions for a token no matter which pool.  Which I know would take some time.  How hard to add a drop down next to the current pair address specified, giving quick access to all available LP's for the current token on the pair explorer screen?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/327186)

    @hmk18990 --- *it's working per-pair. that's why the page named "pair explorer". we can ask the devs if this can be possible in the future for us or not. if enough demand comes from community they can consider it. @FredericDEXT this is a request to show all txes for a contract instead of pair. thank you for the suggestion.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/326942)
