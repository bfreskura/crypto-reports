10. **buy, buy sol, sold sol**

    @JWsCorner --- *I've already sold my SOL earlier today @ $124.   If I buy back, it will be after it gets below $50.   And, I may add more at $25.  But their token will plummet once investors can access their money.    IMHO.  Time will tell.    For me, I just want to access my LP pools and make some adjustments.   I may have just lost thousands of dollars cos I can't adjust my positions.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/913038)
