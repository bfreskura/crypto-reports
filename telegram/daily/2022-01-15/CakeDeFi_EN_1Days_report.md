2. **dfi, dusdc, defichain**

    @averagecryptoinvestor --- *Hi Cake Community, recently startet with Liquidity Mining and would also like to add to the USDC Liquidity Pool. However I don’t want to pay 130$ for an Ethereum address. How can I send my USDC via DFI Network?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164822)

    @mm_phoenix --- *!DFI you need dUSDC on the defichain. you can only buy them on the defichain dex* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164823)

    @Juan --- *Thanks, do you know if it is possible to send  from the light wallet to kucoin without cake?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164948)

    @aemilius89 --- *I can't add to lm with the android app. I can add dusd-dfi but only with simple mode. I can't add any liquidity via the app for decentralized assets like dPLTR or dPBDC. I can do this on the computer though. So it's likely an issue with the android application.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164997)

    @DmgBautista --- *Hi! Currently its still not possible, only tokens into DFI or DFI into the native tokenized stocks. The DEX integration is only complete until halfway, on the direct route to acces the ecosystem. In the future, the other way around will also exist, but its something that takes some time and therefore is being integrated step by step.   Therefore and for the time being, you will need to send your DFI to your defichain wallet and convert there into dUSDT. After that, just send it to Cake for unwrap and you can send it after to any exchange you wish :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164947)

    @Paulius --- *Which one of those is decentralised ?? CAKE DEFI is decentralised right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164777)

    @NuckFut --- *@DmgBautista No worries, I appreciate the thorough response.  That context changes my perspective on why these checks are necessary.  I'm a relatively new CakeDEFI customer and with so much fluff, garbage, hype and scams in the crypto space I always approach things I'm newly exposed to with a high degree of skepticism.  It's refreshing to see that CakeDEFI is both rigorous in its approach and commitment to providing a safe/profitable environment for investors.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164835)
