    @dereksilva --- *This depends on the jurisdiction. I think most are now registering DAOs in Wyoming, foundations in crypto friendly countries, or corporations in exotic locales like British Virgin Islands or the Canary Islands. That entity holds funds AMA can pay contractors via invoice.   Or you go full decentralization and don’t register a thing. The contractors are solely responsible for their personal taxes.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/234156)
