    @rpoole69 --- *@stanes is the backend resyncing? I am getting delays on transaction list and graph* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324770)

    @nate102 --- *I’ve noticed it on a few eth tokens, but only new pairs and then it fixes itself, I believe the price in the trade history is correct however the visible chart is off. You can see the first 3 minutes look like there’s 0 volume but there’s actually a tens of thousands haha* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324613)

    @Undine1 --- *The chart the bot is displaying for my token pair looks ugly. The 12 hour chart would look better* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324576)

    @nate102 --- *https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0x7dec9d12a30eebe5c570fa1603a00c5fc705b5a7, I haven't checked if this one is legit either but regardless u can see there is clear volume (around 400k) first 3 minutes and price in trade history first 3 minutes is different on chart. same bug* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324625)

    @bastardganpunk --- *you’re asking the same question again and again. please ask in the MEER chat. depending on which chain you have your MEER you need to bridge it. you can check bridge solutions here: https://apeboard.finance/ape-bridge  but you first need to know on which chain you have your MEER.
