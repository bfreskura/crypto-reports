4. **sent, address, random**

    @RalphCraig --- *You may have malware that replaces addresses when you cut and paste.  Try cutting and pasting an Algo address into a notepad and see what happens.  If it occurred without you sending anything perhaps your seed phrase was compromised.  Did you store it electronically at all?  Perhaps as a screenshot?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332500)

    @studentoflife --- *Hey guys, i have been trying to access my algorand wallet for a while and my seed phrase is not working on it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332396)

    @RalphCraig --- *That wallet is compromised.  Create a new one and start fresh.  Never store the seed phrase in any electronic format.  Write it on paper.  Divide the words into three parts, A, B, and C.  Write the words from groups A and B onto one piece of paper.  Write the words from groups B and C onto another piece of paper.  Write the words from groups A and C onto a third.  Store the three pieces of paper in different structures.  In case fire or other disaster you can restore the phrase from any two of the three pieces of paper.  A thief who gets only one piece will not have enough information to access the wallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332594)
