    @mislavjavor --- *Yes - players will directly marekt* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36385)

    @Cy --- *Great... but could you say The Croatian National Selection :D That would be a lot clearer for non croatians ˆˆˆ* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36304)

    @panos_dim --- *So AMPnet is focused purely in Croatia market?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36550)

    @tradingjo98 --- *partnership with a national football team, oh god this must be kinda bullish* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36338)

    @North --- *Thanks. Do you think there may be potential for AmpNet to do on an international stage what Chiliz is doing with professional football teams? Chiliz work with a lot of big clubs like Juventus, Atheltico Madrid etc. Their platform and token really took off from this* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36391)

    @North --- *I think many people are not aware of the Croatia deal yet but they will be* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36549)

4. **ampnet, revenue, model**

    @Cy --- *what will Biznisport do in this partnership ? I believe they were already involved on previous deals with ampnet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36377)

    @mislavjavor --- *When there is a chargeable event on AMPnet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36374)

    @mislavjavor --- *If you culd clarify what you mean by sharing revenue I could elaborate. AMPnet charges a fee to all its clients, that is our revenue model, the fee is used to buyback aapx tokens and put them to the treasury* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36380)

    @Cy --- *how long will the partnership last ? (visuals on HNS materials) ? Does it have a cost for Ampnet ? Is it linked to any restrictions ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36390)

    @mislavjavor --- *As always, there will be buybacks - the revenue for those, however, will not be coming only from the successfull collection of funds to the campaign, but also continuously - since AMPnet has several other fees included in the loyalty token business model. As for visibility - AMPnet has been assigned as the main sponsor for the HNS-CFF season and will be featured prominently on all football federation materials.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36371)

    @Darkofmadness --- *Hi,  Do you know when CMC will be updated ? Can't see that ampnet can be bought on pancakeswap* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36467)

5. **polygon, cex, recommend**

    @adhamalkhaja --- *I think polymath does something similar* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36545)

    @mislavjavor --- *Agreed, for low fees at this time, though - I can recommend the Polygon network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36387)

    @<UNK> --- *You kinda answered to this already, but I'd like to recommend atleast some CEX since ETH is congested all the time. I understand that something like Kucoin is now "pointless" until there is enough progression from this "new start", but there is some smaller CEXes like MEXC or AscendEX where you can get listed quite easily and can have decent userbase & volume* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36383)

    @panos_dim --- *Cool, lowcap, do you guys have any competitors in other chains?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36544)

    @<UNK> --- *Yea Polygon is fine, but TBH I never found it more convinient to use than some cex where I can quickly to trade different pairs and withdraw the coins I like. But maybe I should learn it better:)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36398)

    @matejmz --- *Just wondering - wouldnt it be better for them to deploy on Polygon?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36366)
