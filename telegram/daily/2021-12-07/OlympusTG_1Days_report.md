    @Poopoo --- *Yes you have to understand that AVAX is not a stablecoin, it crashed more in % than gOHM 2 days ago so you had to get gOHM with more AVAX, but 2 days later it pumped more in % than gOHM, so when you try to swap you get less AVAX* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/109453)

    @Stevo1010 --- *One other thing, when I buy gOHM it automatically stakes. Is that at the same APY % as on the olympus dao website at 7000%?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/108155)

    @Poopoo --- *I don't see any negatives, you can even see your sOHM equivalent on the Olympus dapp now, I have gOHM on Avax and when I went to the dapp on Avax, I can see the equivalent sOHM there, some people prefer to visualise the number in sOHM 😆* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/109202)

    @kvack --- *I read through all the documentation, treasury backing is a trust-based mechanics. If too many people sell, backing means nothing, sure APY would skyrocket, but other forks may prevent users to go back to the Olympus* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/109314)

    @EnricoMendonca --- *https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/basics/migration tl;dr none, gOhm is the new version of wsOhm enabled for future protocol features.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/108187)

    @africaxgram --- *For me the gohm or wsohm did not work out, I holded it one month and it just went down. For sOhm i can exactly see how much it increses in token amount and whats the token worth. much better than gohm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/108133)

    @Miguel_ecu --- *Ethereum is only worth it if you're investing 10k or more. If you're investing small quantities it's not viable since most of it goes to paying fees.
