8. **end lock**

    @iamJubi --- *Hello. SLR. Your deposit is converted into 75% LP(wbnb and idyp pair) which is subject to IL and 25% is DYP. at the end of lock period, the value of what you will be withdrawing will depend on the current price of WBNB+iDYP and DYP.   You can check on MY stat "VIEW ALL" the current value of your LP deposit and DYP.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228361)

    @YatraNode --- *Hello.   I have some question about the impermanent loss in farm   Lock4000 busd for 90 day in farm.   When I put I understand at the end of lock I have 75 of my investissement in busd (3000busd ) and 25% in dyp. Right?  Because I see today I have lp of idy wbnb.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228360)

    @iamJubi --- *As the v1 farm contract went expired, all users have already withdrew their deposits which results to the high APY. During the old farm was still active, the APY was around 200% to 500% depending on the pool’s lock duration.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228331)

    @Paul --- *Hey Admin.... i noticed that changes were made to the original Buy back farming which if i remember correctly was 100% APR with 90 day lock and also the original DYP staking which was 25% no lock and 50% 90 day lock......Are these changes announced to the group prior to being made?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227976)

    @Disguy125 --- *Omg imagine it was on coin base and you could by automatically staking while you hold on coinbase per a smart contract combined in CB with the zero lock up time and get 50%!!!!!! Everyone would buy hold 8f it was added then listed here.   In comparison it would dominate all others.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228278)

    @JDogg --- *Thanks! I am very happy with DYP project. Last question: after a lock expires, can I stay in to keep earning rewards, or do I have to withdraw and re-stake?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/227843)
