    @ruganalman --- *Thought so, since I could not find it. I assume it uses web3 to listen for created events from the swap addresses? Either way, how do you rationalize closed source software for an industry/comunity that encourages transparency and decentralization, and discourages obfuscation and moderation? I know it sounds like a rude question, but I am honestly just curious as I too try to develop web3 daps in a largely web2 world.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311486)

    @broadgasorc --- *Dydx and paraswap are utility platform like dextools  But they use from airdrop for marketing* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/312099)

    @bastardganpunk --- *We have presales. Free money is not planned atm, rather dextools aims to grow the platform and add more Utility for users. Cex integration is not the primary goal for a platform which offers tools for defi traders (defi traders are traders who trade on decentralised exchanges which is the complete opposite of centralised exchanges) 🙂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/312092)

    @MaratCerby --- *Hello. We've changed symbol and token name on contract side. It has been updated everywhere already: cmc, cg, etherscan, bscscan, polygonscan.  The only place where it did not update is Dextools  I need the following values changed: 1) DEFT --> CERBY 2) Defi Factory Token --> Cerby Token  Is there support email or contact I can msg to?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311052)

7. **deflationary**

    @pityok --- *This will, we hope, greatly increase the burning rate of DEXT and its 100% deflationary character. Not only do we not increase inflation with that 1M from the DEXTShare but we buy into the market and burn everything received.  do we not increase inflation with that 1M from the DEXTShare - As i understand, Dextshare won't increase supply. But are there any other ways for increaasing supply? Maybe some early birds, private-seed sales etc? Or in means that supply of DEXT tokens NEVER will be more that today (and can be only less by burning)?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311666)

    @napascual --- *DEXT didn't have ICO or any ventures/launchpad program, it was self funded, it will be 100% deflationary. Also there's no possible minting* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311671)
