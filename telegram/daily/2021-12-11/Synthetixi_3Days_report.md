    @Mohammed --- *Hi guys I am new to Synthetix. Havent staked yet. Just bought and ready to move my funds off the exchange.  Before I do that, I wanted to understand a few things. A) on the link provided about staking it says  You need to have your funds on the main Ethereum network in order to delegate your tokens.  Question. Is the MEW wallet connected to metamask okay to use?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18124)
