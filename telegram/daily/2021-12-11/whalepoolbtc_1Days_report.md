3. **oversight**

    @TrollsToolsTelegram --- *Plus it's just a necessary evil in any financial market. I want oversight. I think it's just utopian idealism to think anything otherwise is possible* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079087)

    @TrollsToolsTelegram --- *Government control is inevitable. And necessary. Who wants a completely unregulated market full of thieves and criminals. Smart government oversight is totally necessary for the growth of crypto.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4078993)

    @TRotox --- *Oversight and regulation are also a consequence of having mom and pops in the space, there will always be a reflex to protect the less knowledgeable more innocent types. While it doesn't bother me playing crypto degen and taking my own risks, it's a sad reality of gathering the masses in to the space. At least the early movers get paid for it 😅* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079095)

    @TrollsToolsTelegram --- *I just think it's naive to think the space would become institutionalized with no government oversight. Kind of a silly idea at this pt* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4078998)

4. **libertarian**

    @TRotox --- *Regulation is ten years behind and is only playing catch up right now. I suppose it depends on your philosophy, but my tax bucks aren't the worst rip off so on a utilitarian level I don't need to have as strong a libertarian outlook, but I can understand why people in the US might well feel strongly about overarching government that gives little return on every buck paid in tax. Not sure how you square that one as it's hard to avoid regulation and the world that is just what it is.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079085)

    @Painbtc --- *yes in essence, i hold a great deal of respect to the cypherpunk libertarians and the og's in this space and find it hard to be contrarian to alot of normative ideals in todays age in crypto, cryptography and the idealism of regulation. Whats not broken needn't be touched, for more adoption in market aspects i do understand that bodies come into play for echange regulation and the such, however its a very janky playing feild in these times when basically the libertarian class has been pigeon holed from "left wing" to now "right wing" and those who are doing the pigeon holing are essentially blackmailed assets* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079074)

    @TRotox --- *Oh, wait, that was just a tourists fun day out...no the attack on Foxes Christmas tree was the "attack on the nation". For a libertarian, you sure do love guzzling narratives like you're at a bukkake party 🤣* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4078948)

5. **party political**

    @TrollsToolsTelegram --- *I really want an independent president. That's what we need in the USA. Someone who transcends party politics and actually wants to govern for everyone.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079011)

    @TRotox --- *In otherwords your basic American brain want's to lecture the rest of the world on Politics when you don't even know the difference between Socialism and Communism and you can barely even read let alone understand complex political concepts.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4078964)

    @huntersthompson101 --- *a multiple party system would help..but   they will go down the drain anyway..so sorry for the normal people just trying to get by there...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079016)

    @Painbtc --- *he was funded by Cambridge analytica and the psyop that was q-anon was propogated by them as well, just put two and two together, they own both parties they always have* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079033)

    @TRotox --- *Kinda typical that in the land of the franchise, the political parties would become franchises also. It's fucking amazing in a way, people refer to the Dem's and Rep's as somehow being political parties when in fact they are big tent franchises where individual crazies can join and practice their own individual political ideas.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079021)

    @TrollsToolsTelegram --- *I hate the idea of political parties anyway. They are only good for organizing voters but terrible for running the government* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079066)

6. **stroke**

    @Painbtc --- *so whats your angle with trump supporters? does supporting trump make them white supremests* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4078950)

    @TRotox --- *Not all Trump supporters are racist, but all racists were Trump supporters...or is that logic too advanced for your basic American education?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4078952)

8. **businessman**

    @TrollsToolsTelegram --- *The funny thing about Trump is like he branded himself as this highly successful businessman but in actuality he was a total failure at business. He just played a successful businessman on so it's almost like the country elected a reality TV star as president* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079043)

    @Commaximus --- *If I was a pharmaceutical company , I would make my own disease , pay academia / organizations / shills to make the world believe it , and the world believes it within 6-7 times of hearing it (thus brand association)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/whalepoolbtc/4079207)
