    @hoseiinnnna --- *I think devs are too focused on what they want to build or what interests them in particular, and are ignoring what the market and their user base are demanding, which isn't a good sign.   I still remain somewhat bullish on the long term but until the team finishes developing around NFTs (for which there's no real demand) and UX/UI (price graphs) and starts working on more demanded features (i.e. lending/borrowing, margin trading, gamification), i don't think we'll see any bullish price action* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2246859)

    @TomorrowlandForLife --- *yes, you need to have BNB in your wallet if you want to operate on BSC network. Please take a look at PCS guides we shared with tou* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2244225)
