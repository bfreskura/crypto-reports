    @AtomJazz --- *Yes, they will launch their own Cosmos chain soon* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467496)

2. **atom, eth, eth atom**

    @Rshangareev --- *This means actually their users are obliged to buy atom first 😉 but its okay, good concept* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467563)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *You might buy more Atom after reading all 😎* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/468249)

    @chlorophilly --- *Thanks! Time to stack up more ATOM then 😁* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467954)

    @Brad Abar --- *Atoms in the future can be rivals BNB* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467451)

    @AtomJazz --- *I doubt BNB will be able to keep up with ATOM for much longer tbh. BNB is a centralized token, while ATOM isn't* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467454)

    @Cordtus --- *They aren't. There are a number of on/offramp that don't involve atom at all.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467574)

    @AtomJazz --- *Ledger live is not working properly. Use your ledger device with Keplr wallet and it will work like it should* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/466494)

    @Cordtus --- *Yes because ledger is slow. You can claim through keplr using ledger though I did the other day.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467093)

Also how does that affect the APR and potentially losses ? Thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467652)

    @Robin --- *Guess I will keep staking a little longer then haha* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467109)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Hello,not recommended one. Keplr/Cosmostation wallets are the recommended* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467888)

    @AtomJazz --- *Keplr is Metamask like wallet for Cosmos* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/466439)

6. **price, price chat, chat**

    @ZoltanAtom --- *@Atomprice please no price discussion here.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/468138)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *No price discussion on here please.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467947)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *@Atomprice no price discussion on here* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467943)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *No problem. No price discussions here. We have a dedicated price chat for Atom.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467848)

    @Cordtus --- *they generally dont like price chat in here but honestly im not planning on selling it anytime in the near future so while it is nice to see i dont get overly excited* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467813)

7. **fees, inflation, **

    @shiva1508 --- *Where did you find it is 14% in the link9* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/466931)

    @Cordtus --- *Imagine your bank paying you 10% per year* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467230)

    @teachme123 --- *Even if? The price is rising :) the inflation doesn’t matter..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/466937)

    @AtomJazz --- *Well sure they have higher inflation atm 😁* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/466935)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Maybe. But I bet devs think of this. Anyway it won’t be like eth fees. No need to hurry up for now.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467245)

    @Cordtus --- *52 cents is high lol? Also you can use low fee almost every time. I rarely have issues with low fee.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467226)

8. **osmosis, join, better**

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Are you using Osmosis Amm for this ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467335)

    @TicoJohnny --- *Unfortunately Keplr on pc is your best bet, Cosmostation might work but if you need to use Osmosis you’ll want to use the browser app* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/466662)

    @teachme123 --- *Better stake osmosis or Juno… higher APY* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/466933)

9. **bridge, gravity bridge, gravity**

    @Rshangareev --- *So, what I am trying to understand now is the list of apps and projects stated on official web-site, but no bridges are built yet. But you have BSC stated on first page. Does it mean that tokens are being traded on it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467526)

    @AtomJazz --- *Wdym no bridges are built yet? IBC is live and it's making over 3M txs per month https://mapofzones.com/?period=24&testnet=false&tableOrderBy=totalIbcTxs&tableOrderSort=desc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/467528)
