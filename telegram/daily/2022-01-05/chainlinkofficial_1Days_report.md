    @BCdev95 --- *Am I allowed to ask about hiring process of Chainlink here?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/360013)

    @harrumphharrumph --- *I imagine that it will be a gradual roll out as a lot of features with Chainlink have been before like when the feeds came out a few at a time across multiple networks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359551)

    @marcromeron --- *Chainlink 2.0 is not really a "binary" transition, one day you switch off Chainlink and the next day you switch on Chainlink 2.0, but rather a set of capabilities that will develop independently to gradually make hybrid smart contracts go mainstream. Feeds using OCR or even smart contracts leveraging Chainlink Keepers are already "Chainlink 2.0" to some extent, as they leverage the hybrid nature of the oracle networks, given that they post information on-chain but part of the computation occurs off-chain.    This article provides an overview of Chainlink 2.0 https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-2-0-lays-foundation-for-adoption-of-hybrid-smart-contracts/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359748)
