    @Julius --- *I see. How do i avoid the hung state?  It just says stopping cardano node...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/765847)

    @Julius --- *Must just be one of those days.  Usually it fixes itself after a day or so.  First time getting a crash on closure though.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/765856)

    @glitch04 --- *Right but it can still exit in a hung state, if it does that means it was killed before the process was cleanly exited which causes the extended check on startup* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/765844)

    @AskCryptoViking --- *I only ever really use daedalus wallet personally I've not gotten into using any light wallets yet tbh* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/765903)

    @glitch04 --- *If you had a wallet added on Yoroi or another light wallet client you may have to remove the other device first for the new device to function they will have different signatures* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/765896)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *Daedalus is only working on PCs and needs to download the whole blockchain. Adalite.io can also restore 12 words wallets. It is an official wallet, but be careful.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/765484)

    @siamstudio --- *Hello I have ADA from ICO and only 12 word recovery phrase. How I can recover my wallet ? For Yoroi wallet recover need minimal 15 word but I have only 12 word* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/765470)

    @siamstudio --- *I tried to use the wallet Adalite.io, but it does not display funds as they were before Daedalus. I cant upload all blockchain 🙁* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/765501)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *you re not doing anything wrong. actually introducing the recovery words in Yoroi was a mistake. if the device is broken, you need to buy another Ledger and use the recovery words on that device to recover your wallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/765615)

    @Giovanni --- *Do I have to transfer my ADAs to an exchange to sell my ADAs? Can't sell directly from the wallet? Isn't it better to use exchanges directly at this point?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/765921)
