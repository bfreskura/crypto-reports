    @Cryptocx9b --- *Personally, I think we have 2 kinds of people in this industry. One is money crypto, just focus on money, interest. The second one are builders who believe in technology like the way Vitalik is doing now, they don't care about the market up or down. they care about tech.   So money crypto can leave this industry when it has less interest but builder will remain and continue to develop it. It can go down temporarily but still run underground and develop through time* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/889982)
