2. **ripple, xrp, escrow**

    @Skaninho --- *Hope it will, why do ripple sell a lot of xrp many times? I dont get it.. Not that Good for the Price.. ripple is Made for big value. Can someone explain?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3035257)

    @saddique1998 --- *How do I start mining ripples* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3034935)

    @Isolemnlyswear --- *There's some arguements over if xrp is  decentrelized or not. If more the half is controlled by one party they could manipulate it quite a bit. There has been speculation lately on xrp pages of ripple burning the escrow coins as part of settlement. Hopefully it happens.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3034965)

    @Russty007 --- *Also can somebody explain to me how the price is kept so low if it’s not centralized ( when half is owned by Ripple) I mean that’s how you keep control of a company - by keeping 50% of the shares so you keep the power to decide everything (including price?) correct me if I’m wrong please* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3035102)

    @Jake_ripple_XRP --- *No one knows with any certainty... but the SEC's case against Ripple/XRP is considered very flimsy... and it seems to me at least one of the judges recognizes this... There will likely be a settlement of some sort... to redeem XRP's place in the market and the SEC's credibility (if that's possible at this point!). Ripple might have to pay a serious fine... might even have to divest of some XRP hodlings... but in the end, I don't see Ripple at all giving in to whatever demands come forth, UNLESS XRP receives full regulatory clarity and is deemed legally compliant... What happens next? There will virtually be no other crypto that has this standing in the market... Coinbase will likely re-list... US buyers will get on board... Big Money that has been waiting on the sidelines will get in the market... traditional financial institutions will see a green light... It all looks good for XRP... IMO... better than any other crypto...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3034796)

    @Isolemnlyswear --- *Ripple is the company. Xrp is the coin. All the xrp has already been made. Less then half has been sold to consumers. The rest is in escrow.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3034963)
