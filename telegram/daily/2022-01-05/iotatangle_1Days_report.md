    @Basti --- *You mean like the 16000 cryptoa out there? Just inform yourself about mesh+.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305764)

    @PiernasLocas --- *Mesh+ is a project like Helium (HNT) from blockchain.  But Mesh+ going to use the Technology from Iota and LoRa to create a massive wireless network.  I recommend to read the Whitepaper from Mesh+ and later compare the project with Helium.  Right now they have open a Waitlist to participate in a private sale and ICO.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305756)

    @PiernasLocas --- *Mesh+ is different i really recommend to you check their WhitePaper and later see the huge benefit that had Helium on its price  The same that happened on Helium going to happen on Mesh+ or almost it has good probabilities to grow up more than Helium* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305762)

    @⠠⠵ Lucas! --- *Aside from the technology, which looks absolutely superior, what worries me is the fact that Helium has already grown up to becoming the biggest LoraWAN network in record time, and there is no real usage for it by now, being other open networks like TTN much more used and discussed in communities.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/305774)
