    @Tommy --- *I'm still waiting for my rewards from period 1. Does the official algo wallet inform you when they arrive?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/329303)

4. **governor, commit, algos**

    @cryptopherobin --- *Hi Edison -  If Algorand is a project with fundamentals that you believe in, then being a governor helps you dictate the future of the program. The Algorand foundation will present topics to governors to vote on.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/329993)

    @cryptopherobin --- *Algo wallet will enable you to participate in governance.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/329677)

    @danhtran123 --- *How many algos have you committed to governance period* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/329369)

    @pedronelumba --- *@MackDenver I sent yesterday 0.0001 algos to be a governor but my address does not show on the governor list* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/329456)

    @cryptopherobin --- *So at the top of the Algorand wallet app there should be a message that says "Become a governor. Vote on Algorand's future. Earn rewards. The registration window  for Governance Period #2 ends on Jan 6" Something like that.  You'll have to commit to locking up your Algo for a certain lock up period. If you lock it up and leave it alone during the governance period, you'll be paid governor rewards when the period closes.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330000)

    @cryptotuna --- *Ok, tnx sorry maybe I express wrong. And whay there is written that they advise not to committing all algos?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/329574)
