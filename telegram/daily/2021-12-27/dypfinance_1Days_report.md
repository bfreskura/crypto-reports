    @ehgdu55 --- *If I earn 295% APY will I then earn 295/4 every 3 months. So 295/4 =  73%. Since I farm my idyp in a 90 lock staking pool and I want to compound every 90 days!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233717)

    @hemanrock --- *the new strategies from the new contracts are designed for APY.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233732)

    @Tettluft --- *What is changing the apy? More people in the pool, or less?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233573)

    @Life_is_love_La_la_la_la_la --- *Hi Heman. Would you be kind enough to clarify for me something. I stake DYP in the 90 day V2 pool contract and dyrung the last week it so I have seen the APY reduce from around 180% to 116%, as I write. DYP's price has remained fairly constant over this timeframe, but the TVL has fallen by $2m to $3m. What are the greatest influencers of the APY? Is it my investment as a proportion of TVL? Does DYP's price enter into the formula? Also, I know that I can reinvest rewards without extending the lock-in end date, but how about new investment into the same contract? Does this create a new end date for the new money?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233700)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Actually when you are withdrawing in V2 farms you get the token you selected as withdraw and not LP* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233509)

    @KW --- *HI Dhoni - This may sound a really dumb question. please bear with me. Before doing the unpair in uniswap, I will need to connect it to a wallet 1st right ?  it looks like there is no trust wallet from the list of supported wallet in uniswap. I am doing the withdrawal from Trust wallet so I thought the unpair should also be from Trust wallet  as well. Do you have any tutorial to show the step by step to unpair LP ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233996)

    @KW --- *HI Dhoni - what is the difference between claim and withdraw ? which one should i choose ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233988)

    @hemanrock --- *after you click withdraw from https://app.dyp.finance/staking-usdt pool,   you can simply visit https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool/v2pool to convert your LP to normal assets.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233676)
