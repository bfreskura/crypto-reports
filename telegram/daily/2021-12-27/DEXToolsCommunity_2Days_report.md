## 🔝 **Top keywords and related messages**

1. **favorites, chart, favorite**

    @Simon --- *Guys not sure I’m a fan of the new layout, basically I want to be able to see my favourites so I can track current prices of my investments and a single chart together. I don’t care about anything else. All the guff on the left with pool info, dext score etc is fixed when I rarely care about any of it, it reduces the space for the chart and my favourites now have to float on top of it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317457)

    @Simon --- *I still think being able to hide the stuff on the left would be good so I can have the chart and trade history spanning the rest of the width* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/318245)

    @Kratom34 --- *Can anyone tell me how to bring up favorites to add tokens on new dextools page on mobile?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317686)

    @atosm --- *same as this guy. is there a way to put the graph on the left side. wayyyy tooo much info that I don't really want.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317106)

    @CryptoElro --- *looks like any other shitty charting site* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317569)

2. **dextools, dex, guys**

    @matarazzee00 --- *Yes i don't no i want you guys to show me how to list it on dextools* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316985)

    @FredericDEXT --- *This is the first step to make a more complete and modern UI, but many things are still in progress, and the community feedback is the best way to improve and the guide we always followed at dextools since the beginning.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317317)

    @Chris --- *Any way to revert to the old DexTools?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317101)

    @darkstorns --- *I haven't seen a significant change in functionality yet, this is not an update but an idle.  The number showing the price is too small, need blue red as before to know the price movement, I think the dev is imitating some other dex site, while dextools is number 1, who else needs to be imitated?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317980)

    @Monolithof --- *I'll have to agree with this user. Im a fan of dextools, dont get me wrong. But the UI before the current one was better* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/318839)

    @Sloth34 --- *saying "design is fine" lol, that's every user's individual opinion, a lot of people would like to be able to just revert back to the normal "old" dextools, you should make it so people can switch to that in 1 button, just some advice* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/318814)
