2. **lm, staking, risk**

    @mikkelseg --- *Will these affect value of my staking profit* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/157154)

    @DmgBautista --- *LM risks are exactly the same in Cake as well as in Defichain. Or in any other project with LM capabilities. The difference in the rewards is only due to the cut Cake gets, in exchange for the possibility to offer additional services, as well as support and the GUI. The main difference I would say, since the risks in LM are the same, is in the wallet itself. With Cake, you get support and in case someting goes wrong, the team can help and track everything. Your holdings are also insured. With the defichain wallet, you have nothing of that, you are the sole responsible for your wallet, basically your own bank. If something goes wrong or you make any mistake, no way to help. The good part is that 15% cut on rewards doesn't exist. Its basically, a compromise between the risk and the profit you wish to have. I myself use both.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/157129)
