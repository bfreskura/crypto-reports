5. **kucoin, wait, deposit**

    @namjoo59 --- *Hi. I sent my Near tokens to Kucoin ( what a mistake) and they stopped deposits because of " Node maintenance"  It's about 10 days.  Is there anybody know how can i get rid of kucoin?  I contacted with thier support and they are messy and don't know when deposit will open.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/252639)

    @TheGo1denBull --- *Always make sure an exchange is accepting deposits for a certain coin or token before sending. With kucoin you will have to wait until node maintenance concludes. Hopefully they assist with a manual deposit. If it's successful in https://explorer.near.org they must manually deposit. Just wait and then go to live support. They will help you.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/252669)

7. **composability, guys, tvl**

    @frankwizard --- *why do you guys think NEAR ecosystem is not as widely used (or widely recognized) by the world  P/s: Im merely judging from TVL and token price where we lag behind SOL/AVAX etc  - where do you guys think there is the gap btwn us and them?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/251801)

    @NickHaverilla --- *Near's scaling impacts composability in the sense that it is no longer atomic anymore but sequential  Atomic composability can be viewed as zero blocktime composability Sequential composability as x (x > zero) blocktime composability* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/252665)
