5. **money, banks, money banks**

    @Zhang5689 --- *I'm crypto believer, this technology is going to change our lives. I'm a holder but when given the chance to use crypto I'm always in. I don't like selling my crypto.

    @FeliciaOancea --- *Even while I still enjoy the money, it's a wonderful reward, it's the technology that keeps me engaged in crypto.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/15323)

    @AdamNasution97 --- *I’m a big believer that if it’s not in cash, you don’t really have that money because in crypto, anything can drop dramatically overnight. This is why certified financial planners suggest only allocating 1% to 5% of your portfolio to crypto  to protect your money from the volatility.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/15082)

    @mm32115 --- *Bitcoin has shown as steady a rise in value over the years as any other cryptocurrency on the market. It’s only reasonable for Bitcoin investors to be curious about how high it can ultimately go.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/15040)

    @지 성진 --- *Unfortunately, Bitcoin’s price is extremely difficult to predict and even more susceptible to market factors than more established asset classes.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/15041)

    @Richard --- *Bitcoin has shown as steady a rise in value over the years as any other cryptocurrency on the market. It’s only reasonable for Bitcoin investors to be curious about how high it can ultimately go.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/15108)

    @mm32115 --- *Another major influence on Bitcoin’s price is a cycle known as halving. It’s complicated and algorithmic in nature, but in essence halving is a step in the Bitcoin mining process that results in the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions getting cut in half.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/15088)

    @alanshawn399 --- *I believe one of the main factors driving the price increase of Bitcoin is the rate at which new consumers are buying and exploring cryptocurrency.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/15083)
