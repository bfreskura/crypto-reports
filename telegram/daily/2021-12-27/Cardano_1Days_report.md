1. **daedalus, address, trezor**

    @Chillig. --- *Is this up to date ?  The Cardano blockchain has two types of addresses, according to the stage of development: Byron (legacy) addresses and Shelley addresses.  Byron addresses During the Byron era (Finished in July 2020) all addresses were one of the following:  1 Icarus-style: Starting with Ae2  2 Daedalus-style: Starting with  DdzFF Shelley addresses Since the Shelley era started, a new type of wallet was added to the system, these can support delegation and earning rewards, the Shelley-era addresses follow this:  1  Start with addr1 Only these three types are valid addresses on the Cardano Network.  Daedalus shows an error message if you input an address that is not valid (for instance, when using an address from a different network.)  Sending to Daedalus from exchanges or third party wallets When sending money to your Daedalus wallet from an exchange or third party wallet, please always be sure that:  1 You use the CARDANO NETWORK, you will lose your funds if you use a different network.  2 You copied the address from the receive tab on your wallet,  and verify that your address starts with DdzFF or addr1.   3 For an extra sense of security, you can send a small test transaction first to ensure that everything is working correctly on your exchange, once you are confident send the rest of your funds to Daedalus.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762908)

3. **pool, binance, pools**

    @rickazley --- *Hey Cardanians, did you all see a video released by Bankless? They're saying Cardano is a scam and has been paying Youtubers 100% in staking pool rewards.  Source: https://youtu.be/DoAyY1V57RA* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762913)

    @los_yiduma --- *why binance has 8% but normal only has 5%？* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762920)

    @Zyroxa --- *Your coins are locked up on Binance and you arent the owner of the keys. Also Binance is offering "up to" 8% which means it can be less aswell.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762923)

    @JohnGoldberg --- *So I can earn rewards with voting in Deadalus, but does that require a fee? I have all my ADA delegated to a stakepool.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762547)
