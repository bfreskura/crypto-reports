4. **avatars, avatar, unique**

    @Cahbl441 --- *Hello everyone.  Guys, there will be a limited edition of a unique collection of avatars called Cock Fights on Binance NFT in one hour. And these will not only be beautiful pictures, but above all, part of a large project – GameFi fighting with various types of battles.  Each avatar will have multiple uses even before the game launches. Already in February 2022, all avatar owners will be able to get into the White List for allocation in IDO when selling project tokens. And, most importantly, the number of coins that you can purchase will directly depend on your number of avatars! The more avatars, the more opportunities.  Later we will have a sale of Fighting Cocks for the gameplay on IGO. Only for avatar owners there will be a separate sale of the rarest and strongest Cocks from the collection.  So, today at 14:00 UTC o'clock you will have a unique opportunity to purchase Avatars at a cost of $ 99.  ‌Limited mintage, 5.000 avatars.🔥* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/417296)
