1. **ohm, buy, stake**

    @kyle333 --- *Should I swap my eth for ohmv1 on MetaMask? Will that work when I go to approve and stake?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134695)

    @S --- *hola hello !!! if i buy ohm now in a exchange or uni is the migrated version already ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135734)

    @JM --- *As a new staker, you stake and receive gOhm. The price of gOhm fluctuates with the market but also aims to increase with every block. When you come to unstake, you’ll receive more Ohm than you invested based on the number of rebases you staked for.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135360)

    @S00825 --- *So should I buy v2? N stake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134770)

    @nfwaple --- *why not OHM v2? Not too sure if you can stake OHM v1 and what version of sOHM you get, best to ask in the Discord* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134697)

    @Iv --- *Witch ohm must y buy 2 stake, V1 or V2 ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135004)

2. **avax, network, gohm**

    @Z --- *Ok I understand this part but now numbers on dashboard are wrong as I should have like near $1k more and if I bridge over to avax network shows I will get even less..so is this right that we lose some funds moving around? Or is there a issue somewhere or am I doing it wrong 😑  Sorry for all questions just want to understand what’s happening* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134998)

    @R --- *I brought on the avax network to avoid gas fees* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134563)

    @nfwaple --- *correct because the gOHM is only in AVAX, you can bridge to other chains but they do take some fees* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135288)

    @Rete --- *Just bought gohm in trader joe, I can see gohm balance in olympus web at avalance network, when i switch to eth network gohm balance its gone....so is it different gohm in avalance and eth network?  Because When I use bridge in avalance net, I can swab gohm avalance net. to gohm eth net. With lower value* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135286)

    @N --- *Then from there should I just bridge my gohm into avax network straight from there and is that it ?  So after that if i want to take out some money it will cost me low fees as it is on avax network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134674)

    @nfwaple --- *you can hold gOHM on different chains, they don't all necessarily need to be on one chain only, I have gOHM on both ETH and AVAX* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134916)

3. **bad, really, bro**

    @Dr. --- *Thanks a lot to tell me this.   Let me come back to understand better after having lunch.  I may ask some more questions.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134902)

4. **index, current index, current**

    @nfwaple --- *gOHM price = OHM price x current index, current index increases every rebase, what do you not understand brother? if you want you can also unwrap your gOHM to sOHM v2, then you would be able to see it increasing if that's what you prefer...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135355)

    @nfwaple --- *nothing, because the price is made up of OHM price x current index, and current index goes up only. If gOHM price stays the same, it means OHM price has gone down* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134995)

    @Dr. --- *Is there a way to check my current index of gOHM? Oh my... that sounds a little complicated, but it is supposed to be possible.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134951)

    @nfwaple --- *number of gOHM = number of sOHM/current index* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134992)

    @nfwaple --- *yes the current index is on the dashboard, current index is the same for everyone* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134952)

    @ZR_CRYPTO --- *nothing is wrong, look on the app, you will see how many sOHM you have in your gOHM. Multiply by OHM price (currently $382) - this is your value* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135011)
