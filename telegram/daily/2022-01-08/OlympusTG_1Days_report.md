4. **price, market, price goes**

    @David IL --- *6 months from now even if the price goes down to 1000$ we will still be in a huge profit. My question is : if we start taking profit the price will drop and making it impossible for the rest of us to take profit. Because of huge selling and less buyers. 🥲* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143637)

    @fantom2684 --- *what is happening, why is the rate falling? and is it going to rise?)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144257)

    @cdp279 --- *Bro. Do you have to check the price like every minute* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144759)

    @thinkbig777 --- *so even now its overpriced lol, and good time to sell  it worth less then 300$ for real  66-70$ or something* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144642)

    @thinkbig777 --- *yes, and there is no reason for price to go up* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144632)

    @nfwaple --- *buy more multiple times instead of buying a lot at once* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143884)

5. **index, sohm, gohm**

    @DonDaddaa --- *Why does sohm go up but gohm stays the same ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143943)

    @Hdler --- *I’m confused 🤔…,, because all my gOHM are staked on Rari and my value is basically the number of gOHM I have multiplied by the value if gOHM….. but on the other hand I see how my sOHM increases all the time..,* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143473)

    @Hdler --- *But it doesn’t…, it is fixed gOHM* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143481)

    @nfwaple --- *Let's say 1gOHM ($14,000) x 40 (Current Index) = 40 sOHM ($350 each), a few days later, when sOHM holders have 41 sOHM because of the APY, the current index will be 41. Assuming price of sOHM is still $350, price of 1gOHM will be approximately $14,350* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143977)

    @DonDaddaa --- *Yes but I don’t understand why gohm balance not increase only decrease* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143980)

    @Ap0l1o --- *If you have 0,5 gOhm, with index of 59,6 your sOhm value is 29,8* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143472)

7. **ohm, price ohm, tresury**

    @thinkbig777 --- *1000% a year in OHM is good. but, will our tresury growth by 1000% ? will buyers at defi's buy ohm at that level ? to keep price per ohm static* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144683)

    @Daniel --- *will the ohm v2 price increase after it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143674)

    @Andr3w_1 --- *Could someone please explain what happens if we theoretically drop below backing per OHM price* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144075)

    @foodielov --- *im a bit confused theres so many Ohm contracts out there which one are we suppose to buy* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143505)

    @Danimal84 --- *Wouldn't that be more or less the same thing?  Only reason one would unstake OHM, is to sell.  No other usage yet, that I am aware of.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144088)
