1. **cosmos, data, ecosystem**

    @Crypto_V1 --- *Looks like the #Stargate upgrade is gaining traction! $SWTH 45% up in current market conditions thanks to the awesome Cosmos family! ⚛ 🚀  The community sponsored celebration giveaway is now worth $1,250. Looking forward to be part of the Cosmos ecosystem!   https://twitter.com/CryptoRanger9/status/1479800475222478849?s=20* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/470729)

    @DAD_DEFI --- *Why BSC not included in the Cosmos ecosystem? Its built on Cosmos SDK right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/469404)

    @JoeD1rt --- *When is next cosmos upgrade scheduled for?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/470169)

2. **ibc, enabled, ibc enabled**

    @bkc1111 --- *Is there a link where I can find all the blockchain channel IDs for IBC transfer in the cosmos ecosystem? I have this link: https://medium.com/chainapsis/getting-started-with-ibc-transfers-276e9ce91e17  But I can't seem to find the channel IDs in here.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/469170)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *You might start with Cosmos official website;  https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/tokens  IBC-enabled chains are at mapofzones.com* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/470104)

    @Sephirote --- *Thanks, that's interesting.  So if I understand correctly, being IBC enabled allows for better interoperability between an IBC enabled chain (let's say Terra) and another IBC enabled chain (let's say Osmosis). In this case, devs could easily create a Dapp to move Luna tokens to Osmosis without needing a bridge?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/469446)

    @Pastashooter105 --- *LOL. You never used a Bridge, obviously. IBC transfers are relatively smooth compared to bridges* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/470248)

    @MisterKeki --- *Seen some airdrop eligibility searchs where you could put in just 1 type of address, for example ATOM, and it would find if you had both ATOM and OSMO. Seems to me it has to be some way to do it. I dno* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/470304)
