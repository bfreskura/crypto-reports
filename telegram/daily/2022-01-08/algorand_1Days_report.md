1. **governance, period, governance rewards**

    @Chompy --- *9.27% is the governance awards right? Does this fluctuate or will increase in time? I'm not ready to go governance just yet, I was thinking Q3 for governance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330620)

    @Malvo --- *Admin Any update on the governance rewards* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330323)

    @Sayithowitis --- *Hello. Greetings.  I attempted participating in the governance but don't know how it works.  I was asked to connect wallet which I did. What next after connecting wallet ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330417)

    @Shane --- *Does such a large portion of algo being locked in governance leave algorand more susceptible to whale market manipulation?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330419)

    @GanthaMakala --- *how to recover its algo which one has to deposit in governance please?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330563)

    @jonysarker --- *Quick question for confirmation- If we have done governance staking in period 1, is the next round Period 2 is automatically count in or need to commit algo manually for period 2?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330306)

    @Malvo --- *Is there a customer support or admin that can help me* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330357)

    @Lord_Shin_Chan_2_O --- *Admins shouldn't respond my messages... But scammers should...😒🤦‍♂ worst sir...😒* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330853)

    @Lord_Shin_Chan_2_O --- *Can you please check pm sir...🙂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330499)

3. **rewards, reward, wallet**

    @sravan906 --- *0.3 algo reward 😂😂 lol what is this . Is this a reward* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330393)

    @Watduc --- *Algo rewards down to 2.3% only for period 2* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330542)

    @Grabari --- *Seems like a kind of task for software developers, to implement special type of tx for withdrawing (0A to your wallet to collect rewards and then send XA to other wallet). If done in <4s (later 2.5s) there should be no additional microA in rewards. Or maybe there are already an option for it (sending only the wallet Algorands)? 🤔 Maybe admins could answer it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330552)

    @eloquentplatypus --- *When I make a withdraw from my Algo wallet it includes rewards e.g. I send 300 ALGO and there are 100 rewards it will send 100 ALGO rewards + 200 ALGO from wallet. This is absurd. A tax nightmare. It's putting me off ALGO.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330541)

    @kramercrypto --- *You could move your rewards to a separate wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330543)

    @eloquentplatypus --- *Doesn't solve the problem. I'd have to do that everytime before sending any algo out no matter how small the rewards.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330546)

    @MackDenver --- *You might need to create a custom script for it. You should ask about it in our discord  https://discord.gg/84AActu3at* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330538)

    @kramercrypto --- *If you send yourself a 0 algo tx they will be in your wallet, though* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330545)

5. **humans, btc, game**

    @Julian --- *Isn’t there a large chance the US will just ban crypto, especially a crypto like Algorand since it poses a threat to the US Dollar. Even though Algorand is infinitely brilliant and world changing, can’t it just be banned?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330775)

    @Sophia --- *I think I love how this 2022 would turn out to be as time flies, best option to take is to stack as much as we can n farm enough to earn while we hold since the value of a crypto is retained when you do.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330970)
