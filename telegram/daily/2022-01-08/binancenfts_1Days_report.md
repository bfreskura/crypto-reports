    @anastasiaplane --- *Hi. Mysterious Seed is a companion game accessible from any browser. Alice’s Mysterious Seed includes three fun and intuitive mini-games where you’ll need to water the plant, play sweet tunes to it and fertilize it in order for it to grow and prosper. You will be able to plant your seed and tend to it. If you look after it, it will yield a fruit. This fruit will be valuable in My Neighbor Alice when the game is released.   Important to say that the seeds available to purchase only during limited Alice’s shop opening that we do only 3-4 times a year. Other than that you can obtain seed from Mystery Box, such as the one we will be selling during the next Winter Holiday with Alice NFT sale on Binance https://bit.ly/31xzGqK* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426830)

    @anastasiaplane --- *Hi Amir! I see you follow Alice’s channels too 🤗 To answer your question, I would say we had our challenges too during the most horrible time of it. But we managed to stay strong, focus on DAO, and develop the game according to our roadmap.   I think people are more comfortable working from home in their comfortable environment, and how much better can it be to build a game in your pajamas?! 🙂  Thank you for being a part of our community!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426833)

10. **tickets, participation, participation tickets**

    @Yuanxiaote --- *Participation Tickets is not a real ticket, this is the hard cap per user. Once a  user qualifies to move to the subscription phase, users can choose to commit all tickets or some of them. The more you commit, the higher probability of getting an NFT.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426719)

    @Yuanxiaote --- *Finally, we get the last stage-- where you can find if you get the NFT or not. Users with selected Participation Tickets will get to purchase the NFT(s) in the NFT primary sale, and their funds will be deducted accordingly. If your Participation Ticket is not selected, we’ll automatically refund the corresponding tokens to your spot wallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426701)

    @Yuanxiaote --- *then we come to the 3th stage---Calculation. This is the stage for our Tech team, our system will select winning tickets from all subscribed participation tickets in a fair and random manner.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426700)

    @Yuanxiaote --- *you might wonder what Participation Tickets are. Participation Tickets indicate the maximum number of NFTs each user can potentially purchase from a sale. You can choose to subscribe to the NFT primary sale by committing part or all of their participation ticket(s). To keep our NFT sales fair, we want to emphasise that subscribing to more Participation Tickets does not guarantee a successful purchase. The more tickets you commit, the higher your chances of successfully purchasing the NFT.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426698)

    @Yuanxiaote --- *2nd stage is subscription stage: If your balance meets the minimum requirement, you’ll move on to the Subscription phase. Each user will receive Participation Tickets according to the ‘purchase limit per user’ set by the NFT project/creator. Please refer to the product page to see if you meed the requirement~* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426697)

    @V00Do --- *To Effie This is awesome, however on the NFT actual sale, can the NFTs be sold out before a participant try buy or it will be held until random calculation and then be distributed to winners? Seems like lottery, any more clarification on the selection mechanics?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426811)
