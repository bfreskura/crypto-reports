2. **mod, community, report**

    @super33max --- *Scammer are getting smarter and smarter.  This is just an idea: Why moderators don’t put their username in their photo? (Like a water mark)  So, when scammer write you, you can click on their profile and see the mismatch between the username and the username written in the photo.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162323)

    @DmgBautista --- *Scammers usually try to impersonate mods, in order to gain users trust. Please refer to the community guidelines on pinned messages. In them, you'll see that no mod will ever DM you, as well as its against the rules to DM other users. Also, there is no official support in telegram.   Any unsolicited DM must be therefore and always, considered a scam attempt. We dont have these rules for nothing, they are here to ensure the community members safety 🙂 Just block and report any unsolicited DM or call, always!   Unfortunatelly, is easy to a scammer to copy the profile pic and name to try and impersonate a mod. If you click on the name, you'll see that the telegram username that appears below will never be equal, as telegram blocks this, so a scamer may try to use the name of a mod, but never be able to use the same telegram username. Just a tip.   Anyway, the only safe thing is to stick to the community rules, therefore, always imediatelly block and report any unsolicited DM or call, whoever it may look! Stay safe! 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162243)
