    @SkyeFive --- *Has there been any good or solid updates on timescales to enable SundaeSwap to launch? It feels like the September summit was just a smoke screen to keep people hungry and invested? 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m not saying the project understandably needs more time etc… etc…. One chance to get it right and be patient… etc…. Just what is actually happening on the updates and what updates are required… like I say if everything was projected as so fantastic in September then updates to get Daps & DEX’s launched should be more concrete in what is happening* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/766595)
