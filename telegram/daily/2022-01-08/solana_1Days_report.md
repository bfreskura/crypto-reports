6. **network, solana, solana network**

    @DigitalDogsStudios --- *Hello Pulsar I would love to know what the reason is.   On the Solana Status Twitter it says:  "1/ The Solana Network is currently experiencing degraded performance due to an increase in high compute transactions, which is reducing network capacity to several thousand transactions per second. This is leading to some failed transactions for users."  This sounds like it is being overloaded ?   If you know another reason i would love to know your thoughts.   Thank you.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/895270)

    @DigitalDogsStudios --- *OMG ... i love Solana but honestly right now i'm really worried i've invested so much into a platform that has so many problems ...
