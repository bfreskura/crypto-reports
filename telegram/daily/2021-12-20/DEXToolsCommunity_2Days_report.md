    @stanes --- *I hope he can see your badge 😅* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314270)

    @kaspargalactic --- *can you please check my DM* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314427)

    @nate102 --- *Sure but in my opinion from what I see 90% of the scams are just high tax or honeypot. Other ones automatically blacklist anyone that buys etc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313916)

    @DGman1 --- *No badge just an angry bear* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314263)

    @napascual --- *That's a different check actually, there are a ton of possible scams, not only honeypots* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313915)

    @DGman1 --- *how do you find a person that works here??* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314252)

2. **token, swap, buy**

    @roni20212 --- *Can i swap this token busd to mongoose* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314797)

    @napascual --- *You have a swap history on the wallet info. You could filter by Token symbol. It's a Standard plan feature* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/315082)

    @roni20212 --- *No i want buy 50 busd to mongoose* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314799)

    @nate102 --- *Maybe an automatic honeypot check after idk 5 minutes after trades on a token have happened would be a good idea for this? There’s no reason a coin should be honeypot or have high 99% tax if trades have occurred on the token already* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313914)

    @roni20212 --- *Dextool  token buy fee how $  If i swap eth to other token then how $ transaction fee* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314790)

    @ChantalLang --- *Hi, I have a question about your roadmap, please. I have read the 2021 roadmap on Dextools website. Congratulation for all the work and the tools you realized in 2021, and for the partnership with Coinmarketcap ! My question is :  —> Will Dextools provide Limit orders functionality for other chains (besides Ethereum) in 2022 ? is this somewhere in the timeline ?

7. **app, trust wallet, trust**

    @napascual --- *Mobile websockets are not the most stable connections on Trust wallet. They still need to improve a lot (even for Metamask). One trick is to wait on your trust wallet connect screen (instead of going back to the app) and wait until the app sends the Verification (sign) request to your app. For some reason, if you go back to the app the websocket sometimes stops sending data.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314306)

    @JoeyDieleman --- *You can but within the TrustWallet app on you mobile, so if you have the app on mobile in the Dapp browser of the app itself.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314301)

    @HenryMatambo --- *Please guys just stay in Trust Wallet and Metamask and the most common ones, please stay safe* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/315314)
