    @86u_yhLx30 --- *https://nitter.net/pic/media%2FE1l8L2dXMAExklv.jpg%3Fname%3Dorig  Not sure if what you says makes much sense. 42% initially belonged to VCs and insiders. 19% was allocated to foundations.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/323031)

    @ManyWizzard --- *Wsup guys. Look at the article which I've found. It seems like btc and eth maxis desperately trying to keep their chains alive.
