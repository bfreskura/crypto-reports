6. **telegram, support telegram, block**

    @Roxxiej --- *I have and they gave me the option to use telegram* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166098)

    @DmgBautista --- *Also, tale care with scammers, as this is a public chat. No mod will DM or call you directly, as well as there is also not support in telegram, so also block and report any fictional support that might DM or call you. Only the Cake official channels are the way to go. Stay safe! 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/165791)

    @DmgBautista --- *Could you be a bit more clear? Please have in mind that there is no official support in telegram. Block and report any DM or call from anyone claiming to be a mod or a fictional support. No Mod will ever DM or call you and there is no support in telegram. Only this channel or Cake official contacts must be considered. Other than that, boa tarde!  Any issue can be adressed to   https://cake.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new  But if you could be more specific, we can better direct you 🙂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/165671)

    @zachgax --- *The kyc procedure includes sensitive private information. I highly doubt they would ask you to contact anyone via telegram. Especially a public chat group. Do take care and double check your email source. Amd don’t answer private telegram messages. There is no support on telegram.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166101)

    @Kassius84 --- *I whould recommend to check you privacy settings on Telegram* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/165462)

    @DmgBautista --- *He doesnt need to see your phone. Telegram allows anyone to contact you directly, just by clicking in the call icon.   To block that, you need to change your telegram settings to only allow your direct contacts to write/call you.  Other than that, always remember that no mod will ever DM you or call you. Also, there is no support on telegram.  So just block and report any unsolicited DM or call. Take care! 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/165461)
