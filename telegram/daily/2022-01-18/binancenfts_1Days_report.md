    @Jallenreyesm --- *In order to play Dragonary, users can login to the game using their Gmail or Facebook account. By this feature, could you please elaborate to us your game's security feature and mechanism? How would your users ensure that their connected social media account will be protected from Dragonary?   #Dragonary* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/436295)

    @acoinary --- *Dragonary was launched in August 2021, before its launch we made a starting campaign, where it attracted a lot of interest from both the gaming and crypto community. At this time Dragonary has over 1m created accounts and over 235k active users per month. After its launch, we achieved Binance MVBIII August Monthly Stars.  The problem that Coinary encounters in this ecosystem is that for a user not familiarized with the crypto world, it’s really difficult to understand how to take every step needed to participate in NFTs projects or GameFi. On Coinary HUB, there’s no need to have a wallet, it’s generated automatically once you create an account with Google or Facebook.  We believe this is a simpler way for everyone to interact with GameFi world. We want to encourage people to have a great experience when interacting with decentralized platforms, and we are aware that sometimes the process can be stressful or annoying. Also, they have the chance to have contact with a Marketplace and certain currencies.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/436238)

    @pedroveraj --- *the game is great.  I ask you: Will the islands be able to communicate with each other if they are from the same clan or friends to join forces for the clan?

    @Kenikky --- *What role will the “Islands” play inside Dragonary?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/436258)

    @RamiroCH --- *Our goal is to create a system where Island, alliance and tournament are linked. As I mentioned before, to create an Alliance you will need an Island, and to host a Tournament you need an Alliance. The more Island an alliance has, the bigger it will be. A big alliance will be able to host a bigger tournament. So we aim to add benefits, to encourage people to create big alliances.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/436357)
