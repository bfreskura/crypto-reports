6. **btc, think, believe**

    @MarcBMW --- *Last thing. This bullrun is NOT over! In my Opinion, I believe the second this lawsuit nonsense ends, that will start the biggest Alt run in history followed by the biggest BTC run to date. We've seen btc hit a 17x in a cycle. We're only at an 11X from it's low after the cycle. Big things are absolutely coming! I also believe the SEC and the Biden Administration (The worst in history) are trying to stop that from happening. You can't destroy a country if it's citizens are getting rich in the crypto space. I think this is all connected. Think about why China suddenly stopped mining Bitcoin! Ironic they chose to do that while Biden was in office! don't you find that strange? That is the very thing that stopped the Bullrun! XRP will be what starts it back up, in my opinion.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3041317)
