1. **airdrop, airdrops, claim**

    @AtomJazz --- *If you stake now you'll likely be eligible for next airdrops. You can join airdrop channel to stay on top of it https://t.me/CosmosAirdrops* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/476044)

    @CeeNario --- *Ok good advice 👍🏽 thanks!  So it sounds like they’re all/mostly for their own chains, and have directions… likely I’d use a different address to claim, kinda like how I use my ledgers Cosmos app to link to a special FET address?     I’ll continue looking into it. I went to that airdrop channel and some of the messages say “click here” to claim and I didn’t even wanna click those 😅🤣* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/475982)
