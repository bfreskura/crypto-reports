3. **dapp olympus**

    @Poopoo --- *I don't see any negatives, you can even see your sOHM equivalent on the Olympus dapp now, I have gOHM on Avax and when I went to the dapp on Avax, I can see the equivalent sOHM there, some people prefer to visualise the number in sOHM 😆* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/109202)

    @Poopoo --- *What is gOHM: https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO/status/1465410905542385677  gOHM documentation: https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/contracts/tokens#gohm  gohm does not increase, gohm x current index = sohm, current index increases every rebase, you can find current index on the dashboard of the olympus dapp, and check your equivalent number of sOHM when you access the Olympus dapp through the AVAX Network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/111678)

6. **apy reduction**

    @vhaltot --- *I'm worried. If the market is still like this in Jan when we lower down our APY to 1k, how can we survive?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/111119)

    @kvack --- *I read through all the documentation, treasury backing is a trust-based mechanics. If too many people sell, backing means nothing, sure APY would skyrocket, but other forks may prevent users to go back to the Olympus* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/109314)

    @Serg777 --- *Offer even 1000% apy to retail through cex would life changing, buy pressure would be through the roof.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/111882)

    @Poopoo --- *What is gOHM: https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO/status/1465410905542385677  gOHM documentation: https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/contracts/tokens#gohm  gohm does not increase, gohm x current index = sohm, current index increases every rebase, you can find current index on the dashboard of the olympus dapp, and check your equivalent number of sOHM when you access the Olympus dapp through the AVAX Network  Let's say 1gOHM ($28,000) x 40 (Current Index) = 40 sOHM ($700 each), a few days later, when sOHM holders have 41 sOHM because of the APY, the current index will be 41. Assuming price of sOHM is still $700, price of 1gOHM will be approximately $28,700* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/109256)

    @allenkor --- *They aren’t, every time we talked about lowering the apy this has happened. And right after the apy was lowered, we skyrocketed. Smart investors will take the advantage and buy as much ohm as they can and hold and wait for the next leg up. I’ve been here from almost the beginning. We have voted each time to lower and it’s has increased price action. Patience is key* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/110327)

    @Daus_666 --- *It looks like new apy will kill OHM since everyone will sell and move to DAOs with higher APYs.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/111683)

7. **index wsohm**

    @unclejimmmmmy --- *you can only buy gOHM on avalanche, the price of gOHM is the price of OHM x the index* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/110892)

    @Ap0l1o --- *Because gOhm = wsOhm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/109174)

    @Ap0l1o --- *so if ohm = 500$ and index is 50 Ohm, price of gOhm is 25k* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/110921)
