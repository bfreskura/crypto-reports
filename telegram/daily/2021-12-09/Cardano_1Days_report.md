1. **spos**

    @k0ukarin --- *Hi everyone,  Decentralization was the very first point that interested me in blockchain and especially in Cardano. Today I’m a bit worried about seeing some SPOs operating many pools (even if it’s thanks to great marketing 😁).  That’s the reason I’ve just built a website that present small pools with significant results. In the tab linked, the SPOs operate only one pool, have great ROA, a good pledge and a stake around 1.5M / 2M.  Every week, I’ll highlight one smaller pool (<1.5M) to help it achieve the minimum threshold to produce blocks at every epoch.  I’m open to every feedback.  https://www.myfairpool.com/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/756776)

    @Moon --- *Of course. Here are the links to the two stacking pools. They are both in the same pool(ADA Pools A), and the delegate with less ADA(65.83k) gets more than the delegate with 72.17k ADA. 1) https://adapools.org/stake/stake1ux6h23tn33kgu0kgl7ltfe5pathlhvufnm5nxce4pa0utsctgeajk 2) https://adapools.org/stake/stake1ux7sz8nk2g0msh88camrckn74y9pkv45vutwf0hut3jesvcgqt62g* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/756746)

    @Moon --- *Hi. Can someone please explain why 2 delegates with the same amount of stacking hells in the same pool get different rewards?  The difference in the reward is 20-30%* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/756743)

    @DropLipTootsy --- *Great idea a thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/756759)

    @Krieghoff270 --- *The only possible explanation is: You think you are on the same pool but there are several instances in which the name of the pool coincides, but not their ID …* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/756745)

    @glitch04 --- *Rewards are not constant, they are in a constant decay from reward distribution each epoch until transactions on the network are enough to maintain the rewards payout and stabilize the reward pot. They are also in a constant flux from epoch to epoch for each pool based on several factors including a random lottery for production based on stake, it's hard to guess if that is normal or not you would need to look at the data provided by one of the explorers like cardanoscan.io pooltool.io etc to see if your pool is consistent or not compared to similar pools.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/756258)

4. **feedback**

    @Lgbeano --- *🔐🥳Find out here first!🥳🔐  Thanks to the hard work of some Ambassadors, with the help of the Cardano Foundation.. They have put together a plan to implement ADA to Ledger Live.  The community have asked for years, but never delivered (for many reasons). Wait no more!.. after discussions with Ledger, it is felt Cardano has a very good chance of achieving Ledger Live support by using our community and Catalyst funds.  Feel free to share your feedback on Idea Scale  Don't forget to vote in Catalyst fund 7 for this to be possible!

    @apex_pool_spo --- *6 days ago, the address with more rewards had 130k. the rewards are from a period with 130k in the wallet.  with this transactions, 65k were sent to a different wallet:  https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/6f2dad17d35e568f5197e8e3f4a8aa072232337e2a6117b2f3fab0dca0588c49* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/756754)
