    @minimalist_stranger --- *Any Algorand admin here? Maybe something should be up as a pinned message to reassure the community about the “glitches” in the ecosystem.  Yieldly ambassador/admin mentioned something about node issues. Probably good to get ahead of it and update the community here and on Reddit (have you seen the panicky posts?)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322351)

    @Leugim_21 --- *Alright, so algorand is bouncing, due to nature of what you are explaning migrating servers, I wish you could alert us ahead, due to nature of investments and so on.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322330)

    @pabloyabo --- *We are migrating part of the infrastructure, and we are changing servers every day. We plan to migrate from Algorand Indexer and Algorand Node APIs to our own to scale better all the infrastructure; that is why we are changing things constantly lately. We expect to solve these issues soon.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322320)

    @MackDenver --- *We will post any new updates on our technology once we have them. We are already working on a few things in the background* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322460)

8. **chains, project, ibc**

    @MackDenver --- *Hey Yozza, I'm not sure what are you talking about. Algorand and Stellar are different blockchain in the crypto space.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322448)

    @patrick_crypto --- *As I recall, IBC is still having things use Tendermint and Atom..  so you can have ‘other’ chains make use of Cosmos/IBC. Algorand co-chains should just use Algorand consensus.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322213)

    @zechuzu --- *sorry want to ask, is algorand creating sign on stellar?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322439)

    @LifeMachine4 --- *Thanks for the info. I guess I wasn't sure how exactly a CO-Chain passes state info to the main chain as I thought Co-chains might have a different consensus mechanism than Algorand main chains.  While it's indeed true that IBC is most utilized by Tendermint Core chains, IBC is a chain agnostic generalizable communication standard designed for cross-chain communication between modern fast-finality BFT chains.  Will be interesting to learn more about Co-Chains as things progress.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322217)

    @zZeoneo --- *Hi friends, I'm a big fan of the ALGORAND project and I've been studying a lot about it. I was recently researching more about the project and I heard some rumors that this will have a partnership with the Atom cosmos network, I was very interested in this news, because it seems this cosmos network is an old project but it has only just started to interconnect all blockchains . I would like to know from you, what is your opinion? Because if this partnership really happens, it will be fascinating to see our project interconnecting with all blockchains through this Atom cosmos project. What do you think?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322532)

    @LifeMachine4 --- *Anyone know what the communication mechanism/protocol is between hypothesized Algorand Co-Chains? Also, given the fast finality properties of Algorand, are there any plans or talks for Algorand to utilize IBC as a standard interblockchain/co-chain communication protocol/standard?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322212)

9. **cringe, ways, acknowledging**

    @juquinbu --- *It is, sadly, a very common human trait.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322544)

    @leupagus --- *Cringe. Creepy. Disturbing. Inappropriate. All the same.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/321903)

    @Leugim_21 --- *I'm old enough to say that word 'cringe' changed the whole internet way of describe how they feel* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/321902)

    @Leugim_21 --- *I have to agree in many ways, the feelings problem, the cancel culture, people are getting fed up of all that. There are better ways to check on the whole picture, but we can't be THAT cold either, this is Algorand let's have fun.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/321894)

    @leupagus --- *I don't know. Wasn't here earlier. But some of the stuff that comes out is super cringe.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/321901)

    @leupagus --- *If anything they're just connecting all the dots* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/321645)

    @Kmw81 --- *Which page linked you to the other group . If you check official website this is the group* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/321844)
