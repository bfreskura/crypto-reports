    @jimmy_olysport --- *Really no one is attempting to build out a game in the scope that we are envisioning.  Especially as a metaverse where virtual land is backed by real land - we are the first NFT game to do this globally.  But we do have other contenders in the horse racing eSport field.  However - again - this is like comparing the tip of the iceberg with the iceberg itself, as eSport horseracing is just 1 pillar of our gaming mechanics.  This article summarizes our competitive advantage well: https://sports.yahoo.com/horse-racing-metaverse-expands-startup-140009621.html* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/410056)
