    @euroog --- *Might I suggest you jump into the Orca telegram and ask these questions? You can borrow to the limit of the LTV. If your borrow percent increase above the LTV because of decrease in price of your collateral you get partially liquidated. You can borrow as little as you want. The only restriction is that you can max borrow up to the percentage specified by the LTV, eg. 70%. Each vault states the LTV so you can see what you maximally can borrow.  YieldYak is the only platform whose interestbearing token receipts can be deposited into Orca. Here's a video on it, but they've added more vaults since it was published: https://youtu.be/zft6CenpjAU* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313477)
