2. **wavax, avax, metamask**

    @iamJubi --- *Hello. Yes you need WAVAX.  These are the supported assets if you want to deposit v2 DYP farm- avalanche network (WAVAX, USDC.e, USDT.e, WETH.e, PNG, QI, DAI.e, XAVA, WBTC.e, LINK.e, or iDYP) and earn WAVAX/ETH/DYP as rewards. link https://dyp.finance/farmv2/avax* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229694)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Read this Consider a scenario wherein you deposit WAVAX worth $1000. The smart contract will do all the work for you, that means you no longer need to manually add liquidity to Pangolin if you join farming. You just need to complete two transactions on our dApp: approve & deposit; and all the work is done automatically by the smart contract. In our case, the smart contract will split the WAVAX worth $1000 in two parts: WAVAX worth $750 is added to Pangolin AVAX/iDYP LP and WAVAX worth $250 is sent to DYP Staking with up to 140% APY.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230281)

    @Cj --- *any eta when this contract stops today? https://app.dyp.finance/constant-staking-120  after it stops, my dyps can be withdrawn right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230250)

    @sinaht --- *they are both audited and are under dyp rule right? I mean both are safe* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229676)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Hello yes we have security audits from 3 companies and a 24/7 security oracle from certik monitors our smart contracts https://dyp.finance/audit* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229844)

4. **gwei, approve, paid**

    @timdyp --- *Just did a test transaction now, $20 for approve and $300 for deposit. But the Gwei is 127.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229887)

    @shinigamikami --- *I paid $230 to deposit at 91 gwei* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230332)

    @ringLeader96 --- *So I can modify the GWEI for the “max priority fee”? Cause that’s what currently raising the price* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230234)

    @timdyp --- *It depends on current Gwei, here are the fees paid a couple of hours ago before the Gwei went up:  - for farming we paid around $10 to approve the transaction and $110 to deposit the asset. That means a total of $120 to join one of the farming pools. - for staking we paid around $6 to approve the transaction and $40 to deposit the asset. That means a total of $46 to join one of the staking pools. - for buyback we paid around $6 to approve the transaction and $85 to deposit the asset. That means a total of $91 to join one of the buyback pools.  Right now, the fees are higher because Gwei almost doubled.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229925)

    @Jorzico --- *Not sure but in my days I paid $250* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230069)

    @ringLeader96 --- *Yes I understand, however even after adjusting gwei it’s asking for hundreds of dollars (I know in reality it’ll be much less), and I can’t complete the transaction because I don’t have enough funds to cover* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230310)
