    @Radstakes --- *It happens from time to time. You can raise a ticket with Bitfinex but if you try again later it normally gets resolved in a few hours. Happened to me a few times and someone else was reporting the same earlier* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/321677)

    @Artistizen --- *Bitfinex is very slow in recieving XRD. To the point where they have to occationally verify it manually. In my case it is taking days.  If you have not recieved within a few epochs (approx. 30 mins per epoch) I would raise a ticket immediatelly. The funds are not lost, they will find it - just not instantly.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/320734)
