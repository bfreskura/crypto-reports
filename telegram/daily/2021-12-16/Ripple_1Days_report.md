    @cyrilfielding --- *What can you advice me on then* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3022910)

    @AROpitz --- *In my opinion, it’s already closed. All of them only waiting for the best time to publish. If they announce it before Christmas 🎄 it can destroy some families, in case of SEC won. In case ripple is King (won) so Christmas can be really good for some families… so let’s pray for a wonderful Christmas 🎄* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023068)

    @Brian --- *Question on your opinions...  Do you guys think the trial ends by 1/14/22 since that's when expert discovery ends?  I heard somewhere that it's in the SEC's best interest to not let things get further than that.  Are they officially in the trial phase if they let that date go by without settling?  Thanks!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023063)

6. **exchange, canadian, sold**

    @Pahlavimohammadreza --- *Canadian exchange deletes xrp. Do they know something we do not know? Has xrp failed and does a Canadian exchange want to protect its investors? What is the matter? I have put all my assets in xrp.  Please tell me if anyone knows anything. Should we sell and get out? Do xrp owners think of small shareholders?🤔🤔I'm very worried.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023127)

    @Pahlavimohammadreza --- *The court ruling will be announced on January 14 to January 19. The Canadian exchange office has given users the opportunity to remove xrp from the exchange office until January 13 (before the court ruling). This is ridiculous.😠* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023130)

    @Msmsms12345 --- *Hii guys is it true exchange are delisting xrp...? Is it possible* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3022649)

    @WallStreetCRYPTO7527 --- *An exchange needs to have liquidity when xrp moons - this was a super small exchange. Second, Ripple is not going to want paper hands involved in the liquidity hub. I predict they will remove xrp from all exchanges and convince some people to trade for songbird, flare etc.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023243)

    @laugavlagar --- *I wouldn’t worry about Canadian exchanges delisting anything. You can still buy, trade xrp on all big exchange and wallets outside of us and canada. If Europe or Asia start delisting then start worrying but unlikely that will happen* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023132)
