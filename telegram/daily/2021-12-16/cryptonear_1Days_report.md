7. **metapool, meta, worlds**

    @iamkemoo --- *OIN is just awesome! Stake your stNEAR from MetaPool and receive 30% APY + the 11% APY on $NEAR you already get. And when you collateralize your stNEAR to get nUSDO you would get 207% APY payed out in $OIN, and you would still receive your $NEAR rewards from MetaPool. This is mind blowing!!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/241574)

    @why --- *thats what i mean. i decided try metapool* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/238201)
