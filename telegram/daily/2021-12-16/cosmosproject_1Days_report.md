3. **vega, upgrade, vega upgrade**

    @Matt_Blocks_United --- *Yes, it's because they didn't update with Vega yesterday. We missed it too. Give them a break and please be patient. I'm sure they'll be back online soon. The update takes like an hour to install. Ours is in the process of updating.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454225)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Vega upgrade did happen on Cosmos Hub almost two days ago.Binance and other cexs should upgrade their systems/nodes! Unfortunately cexs do not pay attention and not make upgrade process faster.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455018)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Hi there, it’s because Of Vega Upgrade. You should contact Binance or Coinbase and ask them to this upgrade process.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455011)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Yes,unfortunately Binance still couldn’t finish or start Vega upgrade!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455047)

4. **wallet, keplr, wallets**

    @Umer148 --- *I tried 2 3 times but I can't send my cosmos from keplr wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454884)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *If your funds are on cex, you should move your atoms to Keplr Wallet and start to stake them there. Here is link and step by step guide;   https://t.co/eSyDVJMFAD?amp=1  And a step by step guide: https://medium.com/chainapsis/how-to-use-keplr-wallet-40afc80907f6* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454227)

    @AtomJazz --- *Probably the problem with the wallet provider then. We had the Vega upgrade a couple of days ago and they probably didn't upgrade their infrastructure. I'd suggest you to import your mnemonic to Keplr or Cosmostation and start unbonding process there* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454842)

    @cristian_manta --- *yes, it's a question regarding my wallet actually. I'd rather prefer to discuss in private* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454117)

    @cynarix --- *From terra station to Terra wallet in Keplr* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454164)

    @Matt_Blocks_United --- *You are welcome to stake with our node at Blocks United.   You can find us and stake in Guarda, Rainbow, Trust Wallet, Ledger Live, Keplr and Cosmostation.   We have a great staking tutorial on our blog, with video that walks you through the process from beginning to end using Cosmostation and Keplr. There are instructions for Ledger Live in the post.  You can check it out here https://blocksunited.com/how-to-stake-cosmos-atom-tokens/  Let me know how else I can help.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455083)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Hi, how can I help you ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454112)

    @ProfiVL --- *Good afternoon.  I cannot revoke delegation, who can help me?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454836)

6. **validators, validator, vote**

    @Matt_Blocks_United --- *The Evmos airdrop rules are really vague. Regarding exclusions it says, "You have delegated a significant proportion of your tokens to centralized exchanges or 0% commission validators."  Normally it's large 0% commission nodes that are a problem. Not mom and pop shops like us, who are simply offering a promotion.   Every airdrop is different and they are allowed to make the rules. In general, 0% commission nodes are a huge problem for networks because they get too big, delegators are fickle and go with free, maybe not aware of the potential downside of staking with a 0% node.  The Shade airdrop excludes stakers with 0% commission nodes in the top 25 largest from receiving the airdrop bonus. Those delegators still receive the airdrop, but not the bonus.   Currently our Cosmos node is #127 so even though we're 0% commission for another 2 weeks, our delegators qualify to receive the Shade bonus.  Regarding Evmos, hopefully we'll receive it. I hope people post more specific information than what I found.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454630)

    @UnityChaos --- *Kinda surprised by how many medium sized validators failed to do the upgrade and are now getting jailed... probably not a bad idea for everyone to check if the validators they delegate to are actually paying attention and upgrading, cuz if they're not you're missing out on rewards* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454195)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *For example cex validators are generally excluded from airdrops. The reason is for this cex validators are not contributing within Cosmos.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/453870)

    @ragnatela29 --- *Is it free yes? The vote* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455077)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Hi there,I don’t know how to check past votes of validators. On Cosmoscan you can see their latest vote afaik. But you can easy check your votes on mintscan.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454105)

    @Cordtus --- *Yes it's fine I've used it. You need to stake and vote to claim your full amount. Only stake 0.25 or so to save some for fees and for voting later.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454921)

7. **keplr, extension, doesn**

    @EzioCrypto87 --- *Anyone having issues loggin on kpler or is it down* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/453695)

    @garisborfield --- *I have keplr but i cant go on the Web with* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455007)

    @AtomJazz --- *Probably best to write to keplr support then https://keplr.crunch.help/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454901)

    @EzioCrypto87 --- *Ok so i uninstalled keplr due to loggin issues but  now to relog how is it done.?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/453830)

    @Epikur --- *>>> If you have Android device, then you can try Keplr extension with Kiwi browser. But only thing doesn't work is delegating the coins. I am using it daily  >>> Nice! Wouldnt recommend it to new people tho hence there could be some compatibility issues and they would think that they are doing something wrong 🙂  >>> Yes, issues does exist.   1. You can't delegate to validator (it just doesn't show the tx confirmation modal)  2. Sometimes it opens extension tabs infinitely  3. .... maybe other  >>> Brave Android doesn't support extensions, just checked. Yandex does, but it doesn't work properly, Keplr extension UI messed up, unusable  ...  Just checked the Ungoogled Chrome with extensions, can't install the Keplr extension. Maybe browser version is outdated, it doesn't understand the new manifest version.   Opera Android doesn't support extensions too, so only variant left is Kiwi browser.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454231)

    @Danoolee --- *https://mobile.twitter.com/johnniecosmos/status/1469551784867864576  There is also an obvious Telegrambot which ensures youe 22,5 Grav if you complete a few tasks, but to me it looks quite scammy* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454262)
