    @PFCBLic --- *What should i get excited than? Only price leverage toward up is buyback as i am awared.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36968)

    @scemodonore --- *Don't get too excited over buybacks for now... they won't have much impact on pa. The whole fan token sale was more a showcase for the power of ampnet software for me... If they build on this progress we may see some more speculation driven pa in the near future I think.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36966)
