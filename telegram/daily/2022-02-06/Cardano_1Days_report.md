    @cryptoustt --- *daedalus taking 6.6 GB memory and 33% CPU. is this normal?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778849)

    @cryptoustt --- *and now CPU is up to 24%. just terrible* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778852)

    @cryptoustt --- *this was when I started it and in UI it said that it had already finished the syncing. now couple minutes later CPU load is 2% and uses 7.5 GB ram* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778851)

    @anapurnamaa --- *Yeah but I'm not talking about the in-app blockchain verification. I mean the small verification before even entering the app. It gets to 100% then restarts from 0%* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778888)

    @anapurnamaa --- *Guys, ever since I updated Daedalus, it won't stop verifying the blockcahin (before even entering the actual software). It gets to 100% then restarts all over again* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778883)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *close Daedalus and start it again after a couple of minutes, then wait for many hours.  I was not talking either about other checks, I was talking about the check before the application starts completely.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778890)

4. **whale, bitcoin, considered whale**

    @slimjim1333 --- *Is 1000 ada enough to make me a whale?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778962)

    @MrBigK1776 --- *If you held a small amount since then, you'd be considered almost a whale now* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778975)

    @slimjim1333 --- *Holy crap, I’ll be almost 26 by then….* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778974)

    @MrBigK1776 --- *If you hold at least past 2040 or so. Which is still a really great investment, by the way.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778971)

    @MrBigK1776 --- *Bitcoin was less than $5 at some point, and $25 worth of Bitcoin in 2012 would buy you a couple Teslas now. Just saying* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778968)

    @MrBigK1776 --- *Bitcoin is like 12 years old.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778973)

5. **size, storage, block**

    @Paulo --- *bigger storage, bigger SPO requirements (memory + disk size)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778572)

    @Sydney --- *Hey everyone, what is the drawback for increasing cardano block size?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778562)

    @Sydney --- *It was my understanding though that not every slot was filled with a block before* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778580)

    @Paulo --- *it's mainly for decongesting the network. the block size was too small for the amount of demand. blocks were always nearly 100% full, with all the transactions, NFT drops, smart contracts, etc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778577)

    @Sydney --- *So it increases node storage requirements, but doesnt effect staking or mining operations?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778574)

    @Morpheus369 --- *Is it better to store data on-chain or to use decentralized storage like IPFS? Where would you store important data that should last for thousands of years and can't be altered or destroyed?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778902)
