    @Theo --- *How do you track your rebase if your gOHM is on polygon?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/179709)

    @theMagicUnicorn --- *rewards are same for sohm or gohm, they both rebase at same apy ..you can bridge gohm between chains such as poly and ftm, avax, arb, but it may be pricey if bridging from eth chain, altho you can find times of the day that are less pricey for eth gas..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/180354)

    @Flower --- *sOHM is best if you like seeing your units grow and you enjoy paying high transaction fees. gOHM is better if you hate high transaction fees, you like adding to your investment in smaller amounts (which is made possible by the penny fees from Matic and Avalanche) and you have a governance vote.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/180749)

    @theMagicUnicorn --- *Olympus PRO was introduced to the world on September 17, 2021. The idea was simple: allow DAOs and projects to take control of their token emissions and liquidity mining programs through protocol-owned liquidity. Since our launch in late September, we have been full steam ahead and have onboarded 40 partners across four different blockchains and layer 2s including Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom, and Arbitrum. In total, we’ve helped projects bond >$45,000,000 in liquidity and have produced >$2,000,000 in revenue for the OlympusDAO treasury — all in just 4 months’ time    https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-pro-in-2022-c21c4fedb2cc     https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/180757)
