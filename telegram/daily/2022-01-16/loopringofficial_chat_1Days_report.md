    @opsahl --- *I’ve been locked inside for the past 18months and this community has helped me so much. it’s about engagement, learning, writing, and community.    But I can tell people have lost hope, engagement is down, sentiment is negative, positive outlooks are low, and that’s okay, I still believe in the projects I’m holding, the community here is still vast, and for that want to thank everyone here for being on my list of anti-depressant activities.    As the fear and greed index fluctuates in times of uncertainty, I can always trust my fellow cryptonauts to support me through it all!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/24402)
