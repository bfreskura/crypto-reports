3. **farming, address, deposit**

    @Justin --- *I have a question about an old farm I deposited 27 Defiyield into about 14 months ago. I cant see it list in the dapp but can see it on Etherscan..can I still remove it and sell it back to Eth?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/240118)

    @iamJubi --- *Hello. Done digging into your wallet, apologies it took time as etherscan is under maintenance.  You added liquidity (DYP-ETH pair) and approved but I think you did not deposit on the farming pool as I can not find the deposit transaction you made. Remove liquidity here https://app.uniswap.org/#/remove/v2/0x961C8c0B1aaD0c0b10a51FeF6a867E3091BCef17/ETH* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/240122)
