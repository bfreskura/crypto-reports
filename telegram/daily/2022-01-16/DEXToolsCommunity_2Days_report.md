(About 200k volume in those 2 candles total and chart makes it appear like theres been 0 volume haha)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324627)

    @Uturn --- *One more question, regards to the price alert feature, is there a way that Dev team can create a one reactivate button to reactivate all the price alert within one token? It’s really a hassle to reactivate one by one for just one token.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325572)

    @jmorfeo --- *A screen to see return of investment I mean ..%day %week %month ... For a watchlist ...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325226)

    @nate102 --- *I’ve noticed it on a few eth tokens, but only new pairs and then it fixes itself, I believe the price in the trade history is correct however the visible chart is off. You can see the first 3 minutes look like there’s 0 volume but there’s actually a tens of thousands haha* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324613)

    @bastardganpunk --- *Which kind of token returns do you mean? You can use the tools in the chart to see percentage growth of price.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325206)

    @nate102 --- *https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0x7dec9d12a30eebe5c570fa1603a00c5fc705b5a7, I haven't checked if this one is legit either but regardless u can see there is clear volume (around 400k) first 3 minutes and price in trade history first 3 minutes is different on chart. same bug* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324625)

4. **apeboard, wallet, wallets**

    @stanes --- *You can hold 1k DEXT or pay the monthly membership. For that, connect your wallet to the app and follow instructions: https://www.dextools.io/app/user/account* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325005)

    @dougkey --- *hello how do we add multiple wallets? to standard subscription. been doing one wallet, but cant tell how to add multiple* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325393)

    @stanes --- *Apeboard let you have a look at all the holdings on all the chains for a specific wallet. It's complementary to Dextools.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325415)

    @dougkey --- *hi - thanks, yes i have subscription (1000dext).  It says 'multiple wallets' where you add your wallet and 'up to 500 wallets'  there is a link to Apeboard.  do you do it on Apeboard?    so like, when I connect to dext, I want it to show / pull other wallets (without conneting each wallet separately)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325410)

    @stanes --- *You can track all the wallets you want by adding them on "wallet info". But no way to see your positions directly in the charts for the moment.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325397)

    @stanes --- *Hi, not sure what you mean, to access standard membership you need your 1k DEXT to be in one single wallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325394)

    @stanes --- *Please be aware we can't avoid scams being created. We also can't stop smartcontracts doing what they are programmed to do.  We have some ways to alert people of a scam like the "contract details" and the community votes. Can we do more? Yes, we are working on adding more tools to reduce the risk for our users to fall into scams. But be sure there is no way to be secure if you don't DYOR.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325424)
