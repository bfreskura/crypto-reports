1. **btc, good, l1s**

    @wonderwarraior --- *I don't think it can outperform buying early in L1s and holding for many multiples but maybe it works for you. thanks for sharing anyways* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717117)

    @besselBeat --- *Dominance of Alts excluding ETH update: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Wvw0tc8o/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717261)

    @brendanplayford --- *I also like selling into positive money flow as the green shows money flowing-in. I like buying when money is flowing out which would be red* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717102)

    @BeAMightyKing --- *I'm thinking similarly, as it's hard for me to see most top 20 L1s seeing significantly more upside without BTC 1st clearing $69k, past $100k & beyond.  But maybe this is old skool thinking and perhaps we've transitioned to a market where BTC & alts move up together without a surge in BTC dominance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717142)
