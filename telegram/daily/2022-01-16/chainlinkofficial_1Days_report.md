    @Luckygirlkate --- *Currently we use Chainlink’s VRF to pick random winners from our Zaps, as we expand across additional chains, VRF will be used for native Zaps on each one.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364689)

2. **yield, chains, contracts**

    @Luckygirlkate --- *Further along the road, we’ll be releasing among other features:  Support for more chains, Polygon, MultiVac, Ethereum of course and more.  A bond market, a reactor-powered secondary market to purchase Recharge tokens at a discount, funding a yield-earning treasury that increases the protocol yield.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364712)

    @marcromeron --- *Kate Wilson -Recharge (Will not DM first): We’ve been hard at work on V2 which we expect to release this spring which will have a number of improvements notably optimized yield, compatibility with newer DEX protocols, the foundations for a fully decentralized DAO and a lot more. You can find out more here:  https://medium.com/recharge-finance/whats-coming-in-v2-2bc373e5ee87* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364710)

    @Luckygirlkate --- *The more you utilize the recharge ecosystem and participate with r3fi and rcore the more opportunity you have to be a driving force for change.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364704)

    @m0crypto --- *Any developer can hook into our reactor contracts to create extensions of the Recharge ecosystem for any purpose, drawing on existing token yield pools to fund the extensible protocols.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364697)

    @m0crypto --- *We're building an entire economy based on decentralized taxation and decentralized, unbiased distribution with no middle-man. A fair and rewarding tax economy with a variety of financial products vs a token only focused on the economy of attention.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364684)

    @Luckygirlkate --- *This is a bit of a long answer, but well detailed for the communities.   Recharge is a cross-chain ecosystem built around the idea of working together as a community for mutual benefit. The DeFi space is exciting but extremely fragmented across multiple chains with thousands of tokens, each requiring constant staking, unstaking and bridging to benefit from. We’re doing away with all of that with a token that builds value directly in your wallet on any supported blockchain.  With Recharge, there are no extra steps, no staking or lockups, it just works and because of this, is instantly available for use and can be stored in any type of wallet. Being in possession of your tokens at all times reduces risks by limiting the number of contracts you need to interact with while offering completely passive yield similar to a traditional savings account.  The Recharge token is the just tip of the iceberg, with our native bridge we can expand seamlessly across supported chains and fairly distribute the yield across them. Recharge Assets will enable the same seamless and passive yield on stable, wrapped assets, again seamlessly on multiple chains.  Another interesting feature, our Reactors—a mutualized yield pool where the yield is redirected and powers custom contracts and different reward mechanisms. Developers can implement their own contracts and get voted in to draw from this yield. Recharge holders can swap for RCORE, effectively donating their yield to the reactor in exchange for various rewards.  Our first Chainlink integration is actually powered by one of the reactors, Recharge Zaps draw yield from it and distribute it through giveaways secured by Chainlink’s VRF. Thanks to the passive yield generation the zaps are funded at no cost and allow anyone to enter with no financial barriers as part of our commitment to bring more people to decentralized finance as a member of the GoodFi movement* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364677)
