9. **staking, stake, decentralized**

    @GabrielaTarabuta --- *Hi guys! 😊 If you want to find out more about staking versus trading, we've written an article on this topic. You can check it out here 👇  Check it out here: https://stake2earn.medium.com/staking-or-trading-what-do-you-choose-f5f6ade01669* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/903995)

    @Adel --- *You can never transfer to stake  😂😂, it's a commitment you do on your regular exchange, not too anybody in person, so that Decentralized.. Staking can never be Centralized which would be in form of like P2P* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/903692)

    @GabrielaTarabuta --- *In centralized validators, staking apy varies based on what they want. If you make the average per an year you might see that you didn’t earn as much as you could with a decentralized validator. Also, if you want to redeem earlier your amount you cannot or you can but you loose what you earned so far. This is not happening in decentralized environment* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/903677)

    @Karthik --- *Hello all..Which platform is giving the best APY for SOL to stake?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/903487)

    @C_Sonita --- *Remember. If you want to stake but you don’t know how to stake. I can help you out here* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/903868)

    @GabrielaTarabuta --- *I don’t think we are talking about the same thing. Providers that manage the entire Amount and staking process on behalf of the user is centralized. These services are often provided by crypto exchanges, such as Binance or Coinbase. Users simply deposit or transfer their funds into the exchange and the provider will handle the rest.  The decentralized staking is a trustless implementation for staking and hence do not retain custody over its users assets in any way. In sol, this means a service that is provided by a validator set-up and management, but does not hold user private validator keys AND withdrawal keys. This is an important distinction as many services will claim to be decentralized and non-custodial although they maintain custody over user validator keys.  Decentralized Staking Benefits are:  • Complete control over private keys and Sol  • Mitigates security risks  • Promotes network and industry decentralization* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/903700)
