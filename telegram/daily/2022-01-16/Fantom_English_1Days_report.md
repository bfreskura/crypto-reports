    @radovid5 --- *no, i have ftm in binance wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/631466)

    @Lucy_hill --- *Hi Everyone Hope you're all well.  I have made quite a major error with a substantial amount of FTM - and I am really hoping someone can help.  I sent FTM from Binance on FTM, to a friends exchange wallet - but the address he gave was for USDT and network Bep20. Also the exchange I sent to doesn't support FTM. Unsurprisingly, he hasn't received the FTM.  The transfer completed. And the transaction ID looks as though its an exchange - as the coins were moved out shortly after. And there are a lot of transactions linked to the destination address. I have contacted his  exchange (I also have an account with them) and they have their technical team looking into it... Anything else I can do?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/632268)
