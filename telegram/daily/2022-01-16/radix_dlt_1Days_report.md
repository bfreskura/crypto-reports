    @tesslerc --- *There's a community initiative to do some additional marketing activities. We've been active since Radix has launched as an ERC20 and have recently ramped up activities when we brought on Stefan 🙂  You can read more in the other channels, but I think we're going to do super cool stuff together 🙂 I believe we'll see the tube red-orange-yellow colors a lot more (https://getradix.com/) as a way to represent community initiatives going forward (and differentiate from the core team activities).* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339908)

Ben's okay, a supposed nuclear scientist gone BTC maxi, just not sure of his in depth network knowledge. Youtube influencer with almost 700k subscribers. Let's invite him for more teachings on Radix. https://twitter.com/intocryptoverse/status/1482221672035983361* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340037)

    @samuskycoin --- *ISO4217 - currency codes requires any 3 digit non-country specific currency to start with an X. No official country code can begin with an X (ISO 3166) and therefore it ensures a currency starting with an X will never clash with a country specific code. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340446)

    @dopermon12 --- *Ive never heard of anyone using cardano's network. How is that guy saying 1.2m people use it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339590)

    @Null_v0id --- *I don’t hate Cardano because it’s Cardano. I like variety, but Cardano tech just doesn’t stack up..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339631)

    @happyDog44647 --- *Cardano aint do anything well. It’s Ergo performed that transaction. But I get your point.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339815)

    @TheWarOnDrugs --- *hope he's ready for the cardano cult* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339564)

    @happyDog44647 --- *yes, Cardano now is living off Ergo’s ability, both are using eUTXO models. There must be some reasons Kushti left Cardano to create Ergo, I guess 🙂    https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1480945016336154624* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339768)

    @Bent --- *I feel like Cardano chose exactly the wrong type of dapp to showcase the strengths of their UTXO model when they're going so strong on DeFi so soon. There must be other types of dapps that would be better served by their architecture.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339666)

6. **beer, morning, uk**

7. **l1, scaling, layer**

    @Bent --- *I can see there being L2s for highly specialized use cases that are poorly suited for the L1. E.g. you could have an L2 file storage chain which would make sense because 1) the L1 architecture is poorly suited for storage of large binary data and 2) files are read way more often than they are written to so cross-chain synchronization is very rarely needed.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339681)

    @samuskycoin --- *@piersr @jacob_XRD  What do you think of the idea discussed in Trader channel for a Radix slogan competition? Some feedback on current slogan (10x, 100x etc.) suggests it is not hitting home. Neither is the messaging about 1000x better than Algorand or whatever - seems that one is possibly counterproductive.  “Building the base layer of global, scalable DeFi.”  ^There’s my entry if we have such a competition.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340481)

    @fpieper --- *I would say yes, maybe we will have one or two others, but IMHO definitely not more.  The current situation with 10s-100s of competing layer 1 is because no DLT was truly capable of scaling and delivering a safe environment for developers and users yet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339781)

    @aus87 --- *I have been thinking about this lately, dont have any good examples.  Also Ive been seeing some L1s out there having their own proprietary "enterprise" layer or some secret centralized setup in order to increase speeds.  I wonder if that sort of thing will have any popularity.  Personally I am all about maximum decentralization.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339672)

    @fpieper --- *Also ETH is still number one besides others being faster, but this shows how strong network effects are.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339784)

    @mx471 --- *You need L2 scaling solutions when you have failed with L1 scaling. Or are there other reasons?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339678)

8. **ignore, reviewing, lots**

    @TheWarOnDrugs --- *Just be ready for them to ignore your arguments, latch onto something they can pull out of context, and then form an echo chamber of "you don't know what you're talking about", as if they do.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339572)

    @Cpt_Charles --- *Yea, they’re not that good at debates either. They refuse to elaborate their claims and just send you some link to one of the peer-reviewed pappers, that most of the time touches a totally different subject 😂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339837)

    @MaratCerby --- *It is a cult I guess, you can't convince him in anything else.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339835)

    @ITProfligate --- *The article if anyone is interested. https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/when-distributed-ledgers-and-trust-infrastructures-just-become-as-natural-as-ethernet-and-sql-bf49eff6c3af* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340162)

    @danhughes --- *Lots of noise means lots of eyes. Good for us* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339571)

    @hanisome --- *Just reviewing stuffs. Don't mind me. 😂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340420)

9. **scrypto, scryptopunks, babylon**

    @Jazzer9F --- *The November Radix Roundtable is now live.

    @Stuart_RadixPool --- *I am only referring to how it works with Olympia/Alexandria at the moment.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339945)

    @Jazzer9F --- *We’re pleased to announce that Radix Alexandria has launched!  Scrypto is a game-changer for DeFi, developers, you can get started with Scrypto now.  Full Announcement: https://www.radixdlt.com/post/alexandria-scrypto-is-here* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340021)

    @peterkimkz --- *Babylon would launch on this year right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340356)

    @fpieper --- *Scala is probably used for Ergo's off ledger execution bots.  Scrypto is the smart contract language of Radix. Scrypto uses more or less Rust syntax and provides native asset as a feature for the devs at their fingertips.  It is very easy and safe to learn and drastically reduces the risk for hacks and exploits and reduces the time to market for developers.  Scrypto is a game changer and Radix's unfair advantage.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/339758)

10. **price, tps, fee**

    @ahsimon --- *AFAIK the plan was always to decrease fees (as measured in XRD) so that fees (as measured in dollars) stays about the same 1c-10c.  I expect the team will make a manual adjustment as soon as more urgent tasks are behind them.  After Babylon, I expect an oracle based SC to automate the process, so I don't expect a lot of future  deflation.   Plus, the whole fee model is likely to change once there is time to address the 40-year cliff, which I think comes with or after  Xi'an.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340087)

    @tesslerc --- *Don't forget that if we're running millions of TPS then due to the burn rate the price must go up (at the current price at millions of TPS it is highly deflationary).  And when price goes up, the same emissions are now worth much more.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340076)

    @happyDog44647 --- *Appeciate this. Every solution always carries pros and cons. Those were the pros you mentioned, what about the cons? I would imagine more energy consumed or more fee costed?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340293)

    @tesslerc --- *I still don't get the issue here. Why would 300m XRD not be sufficient?  At 1 million TPS the price of each XRD needs to be way over $200 in order for it not to be deflationary. This means that unless the price goes up dramatically (at 1m TPS) then the supply will start burning really fast (until price goes up).  So those 300m XRD will be worth a lot more in $ terms by the time we successfully utilize the network at 1m TPS.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340440)

    @Mik3ology --- *Just a quick example. Maybe slightly touching on price talk. With a 1 cent tx fee and a stable token price of $10 for one year, the tx fee would be 0.001 XRD.  If the network ran for one year at an average 100K tps. We would have burnt 3.1536 billion xrd.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340120)

    @tesslerc --- *It's all a complex economic system just like Bitcoin mining. Hash rate affects price but it also works the other way around.  Topic slightly touches price talk and speculation so I won't dig deeper into this stuff.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/340078)
