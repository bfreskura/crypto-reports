    @vorpalmusic --- *Hey guys, I have access to a small but monied audience and I'm trying to encourage them to stake a bitcoin at Cake this month. People are asking about counterparty risk and I can't really find any information on the website. What kind of rights do we have if Cake gets hacked or suddenly implodes or whatever?
