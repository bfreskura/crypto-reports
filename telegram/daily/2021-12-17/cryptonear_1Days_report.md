5. **project, profit, projects**

    @cattuongvyy --- *The main purpose of a project is profit. Profit comes from revenue-expenses. Grants from the parties for the project are considered support only and do not count as revenue. I'm looking to dig deep into what the project can actually do. No investor pours money into a project that is not profitable. I am not considering token appreciation here. You misunderstood what I meant. :(* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/240530)
