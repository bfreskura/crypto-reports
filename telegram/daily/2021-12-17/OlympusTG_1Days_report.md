    @Poopoo (never dm first) --- *Missing or incorrect data?  • Olympus v2 is currently being launched. • APY is lower as we have to leave some supply in OHM v1 for now (including in liquidity). This will change over time. • Website, app, and Dune dashboards may temporarily show incorrect data for treasury value, backing, and runway.  🙏🏽 Please be patient and don't rely on that data until the launch has been completed.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/123777)

(Yeah I know) and within minutes all my assets cleared out* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/124481)

    @Ap0l1o --- *market correction man... chill and do not watch the price* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/123610)

    @Cen_Boplin --- *Oh I am in it, just concerned with all that’s happening, price drop, treasury drop, backing drop, all are bad signs.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/123607)

    @jianye --- *why is market value of treasury asset dropping dramatically these days, these asset cannot be withdrawn if I understand correctly* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/123963)

    @mengjack22 --- *the bond discounts look a bit wacky right now* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/124597)

    @rhythmmaster --- *I think people are freaking out because even though the price falls, they see the accrual of more ohm.  Where as with gohm, you just see a value, and if you wake up and see a lower value of 10k USD, the first response is to think it is not increasing because the numbers aren't in your face.  My 2 cents worth anyway* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/124611)

    @cdp279 --- *lol  the best is - "why price go down? DEVS do something!!!"* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125848)

5. **apy, runway, ratio**

    @Ravish83 --- *Apy didnt increase it s error or what 4000%* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/123776)

    @r0b0k1d --- *Wrong. The key is to understand the difference between APY and APR.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125528)

    @Poopoo (never dm first) --- *dynamic, apy and runway are related, usually less apy > longer runway, and they are both impacted by bonding as well, please join the Discord to ask this question, you'll get better answer there* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/124648)

    @Max --- *I know they are related and that the change in APY changes the runway. . But is this relation (or ratio) dynamic or static? PD: if nobody can answer I will ask on discord of course* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/124661)

    @Daus_666 --- *Is there any difference in APY between v1 and v2? V1 APY is very low atm.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/124559)

    @syberk1d --- *The less people that are staked into the project, the more the apy goes up,   I’m also confused here as what it looks like on paper is  More people have staked for it to drop in apy so drastically, when in actual fact we pretty much can safely assume it’s the opposite since the migration, more people have been uneasy with it, and complaining, so I put my money on it that more people would of no doubt in staked and got out, thus , the apy should of gone up due to this, I’ve lost a lot of faith in Olympus, I have more faith in my wonderland bag than Olympus now, feel like they have robbed us of nearly 50% of potential 3,3  future gains* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/124918)

6. **v2, v2 migration, migrate v2**

    @DD0820 --- *i understand there will be plebs who cry and whine and say “oh i invested in $1000, whatever” but the V2 migration does cause some confusion and these things do weigh on credibility. the price whiners are silly, but the V2 migration speed and professionalism is something project team needs to take responsibility for* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125349)

8. **rebase, v1, rewards**

    @GSG_AP --- *Question regarding rebase, is every rebasing happening every 8 hrs without delay?  If so, the rebase moments should always be at the same times of the day but it seems it changes everyday* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125190)
