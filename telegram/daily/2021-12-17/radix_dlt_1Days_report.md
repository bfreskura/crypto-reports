1. **bitfinex, kyc, buy**

    @Danba --- *Anyone know how long Bitfinex has been messing up the deposits of XRD now and not being able to credit them. Not too impressive when it is the only exchange for XRD.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322171)

    @JA --- *Hi people,  For all those who are too paranoic about their seeds phrases.  I'd like to share what I do:  1. I use vmware. 2. I install a clean ISO downloaded DIRECTLY  from microsoft site: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO 3. I install Keepass & Radix Wallet inside that virtual machine. No more. 4. The seed never leaves that Windows installation. And I never install ANY other software than keepass & Radix Wallet.     Extra notes: - Just the encrypted keepass file with my seed can exit that isolated windows environment. - When typing your seeds inside the vmware isolated version, you can type lots of text between your safe words. In case you have a keylogger or something. - Never ever store or type or watch your seeds in an "un-clean windows environment", like kmspico, etc. - I still don't know how to disable screenshoting from the guest os.     Not perfect but an extra layer of security, I think.  Hope it helps. JA* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/321789)

    @Matus1682 --- *hey anyone got any recent issues with withdrawal from bitfinex. my radix address is suddenly marked as invalid, and it was working previously without a problem. just opened a support ticket.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322483)

    @jafaroff55 --- *What do u mean by ‘their own pages’? Where will people find radix investors?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322331)

7. **defi, scaling, network**

    @mx471 --- *L1 scaling is not the main problem, but maintaining cross-shard atomic composability is.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322885)

    @israilito --- *Yeah , separating Computational and Settlement Layers. Same as Polkadot and Eth 2.0. I don't see any problems though* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322871)

    @Jacob_XRD --- *There's more to #DeFi than flash loans and decentralized  exchanges.    This article explores the basics of how passive investing works, and how a $21 trillion industry could be reimagined in DeFi.   https://www.radixdlt.com/post/why-defi-is-the-future-of-passive-index-investing* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322712)

    @NotBen --- *i think solana correctly identified that atomic composability is very important for defi. i don't like how they count network gossip as "transactions" and inflate their tps numbers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322900)

    @NotBen --- *cross shard atomic composability == L1 scaling* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322888)

    @S --- *Rollups + data availability sharding has nothing to do* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322869)

8. **scrypto, rust, solidity**

    @S --- *Is scrypto human-readable or compiled, btw?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322630)

    @fpieper --- *You can watch or (skip through) this video - pointing out the differences between Scrypto and Solidity - it is mind blowing even if you don't understand all/much of it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iblv3xeg4HM  TLDR: Scrypto is relatively easily readable even if you are not a developer and Solidity is kind of crazy.   Or this short intruduction to Scrypto: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu8L-BJFfQM I would say even if you don't have much prior developer experience it should be quite easy to follow what is happening in general* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322647)

    @mx471 --- *Soon the requests from other projects to implement Scrypto will be coming in en masse* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/321521)

    @mx471 --- *Getting started with Scrypto! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu8L-BJFfQM  Russell’s Radiswap Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iblv3xeg4HM* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/321562)

    @S --- *Yes. And, speaking as some guy on the internet, looking at the philosophy behind scrypto it makes a lot sense* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322601)

    @S --- *I agree that scrypto most prob. has all of these perks. But more options is always good imho* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/radix_dlt/322596)
