7. **lp, avax, 75**

    @chunshern90 --- *my LP deposit - 63.82 IDYP/WAVAX (Valued $1,900.30) <- Is this value fluctuate?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230269)

    @sb3ee --- *Okay this is a question/s for the patient here among us.    Say I staked 5 avax in v2 .  It’s broken to 75:25 avax/ dyp.   That leaves me holding 4 avax  And roughly 200 dyp.   If I hold in LP hypothetically 6 months.  Presuming for my example AVAX does really well as far as future price.  And it doubles in 6 months to $200 an avax.    I withdraw my original avax out of LP will I get my same 5 avax back or will it be lost someway.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230452)
