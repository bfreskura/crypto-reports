    @SantiagoHernandezH --- *Hi everyone! Do any of you know the correct method of withdrawing LINK from my node after connecting the node wallet to Metamask?

    @spicystimuli --- *hey there! So you can either purchase 1, 3, or 10 DigiBudz, and the unit price decreases depending on the bundle. It is 0.06 wETH per Bud for 1 DigiBud, 0.05 wETH each for 3 DigiBudz, and 0.04 wETH each for 10 DigiBudz (plus a small gas fee in Matic)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355565)

    @whitecryptocow --- *DigiBudz are truly unique creatures–there is nothing like them out there! The backstory: before the first spring blossom there was a secluded field of wildflowers that were tainted by radioactive byproducts from a secret underground lab run by crazy scientists experimenting with the forces of nature. When it was time for the flowers to bloom, out popped the DigiBudz!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355536)

    @spicystimuli --- *We also have semicolon eyes for some of our DigiBudz, which is symbolic tribute for those that were once suicidal but chose to not end their lives. The reference for this is from "The Semicolon Project"* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355552)

    @whitecryptocow --- *DigiBudz is a 10k generative NFT project dedicated to mental health advocacy. Our goal is for DigiBudz PFP’s be a symbol for those you can talk to without judgment. DigiBudz is a play on “digital buddiez” and we have grown our community through avenues such as twitter and discord. Some things we do to promote mental health advocacy includes our “Therapeutic Tuesday” twitter spaces, our “Real Talk” channel on discord, and we plan to donate 10 wETH to a community chosen charity focused on mental health advocacy after 75% of DigiBudz have been minted.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355532)
