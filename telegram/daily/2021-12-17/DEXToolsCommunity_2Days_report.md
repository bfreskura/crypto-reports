    @jimmyvee --- *@stanes - I don't see any other way to contact you so I'm reaching out here.  I participated in the April 2021 raise for $BUMP Bumper Finance. @frederic will not respond to DM's on TG.  I am due my tokens from that deal.  Can you please let me know when we'll receive the tokens, and/or who I should contact regarding this matter.  Thanks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313816)

4. **scam, coin, scam coin**

    @JunLOA --- *How do we downvote scam coin?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313139)

    @JunLOA --- *Smart? We need to downvote scam coin But we have to pay first* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313188)

    @napascual --- *That's a different check actually, there are a ton of possible scams, not only honeypots* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313915)

    @nate102 --- *Sure but in my opinion from what I see 90% of the scams are just high tax or honeypot. Other ones automatically blacklist anyone that buys etc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313916)

    @nate102 --- *Maybe an automatic honeypot check after idk 5 minutes after trades on a token have happened would be a good idea for this? There’s no reason a coin should be honeypot or have high 99% tax if trades have occurred on the token already* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313914)
