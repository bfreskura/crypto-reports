    @oguzhan01010101 --- *I want to add my keplr wallet to transfer interchain. https://mapofzones.com/ ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455105)

    @Matt_Blocks_United --- *You are welcome to stake with our node at Blocks United.   You can find us and stake in Guarda, Rainbow, Trust Wallet, Ledger Live, Keplr and Cosmostation.   We have a great staking tutorial on our blog, with video that walks you through the process from beginning to end using Cosmostation and Keplr. There are instructions for Ledger Live in the post.  You can check it out here https://blocksunited.com/how-to-stake-cosmos-atom-tokens/  Let me know how else I can help.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455083)

    @AtomJazz --- *Hi. Keplr wallet is the best to stake and collect various airdrops in the ecosystem. You can find tutorials in the pinned message. Cosmostation is also recommended wallet for staking* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455530)

    @AtomJazz --- *Keplr and Cosmostation are the suggested wallets. Exodus is not ideal for Cosmos.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455132)

4. **ibc, ethereum, hub**

    @Matt_Blocks_United --- *Generally with bridges there are tolls on both sides. Let's say you wanted to bridge an Ethereum token over to Cosmos to save money on transaction fees. You'd need ETH in your Ethereum wallet to enter the bridge and then ATOM in your Cosmos wallet to get your tokens off the bridge and onto Cosmos.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455774)

    @Zeuscryp --- *How is atom different from ethereum blockchain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455720)

    @JUAN88 --- *IMO ATOM is just the first IBC Blockchain.  I don't think it's more meaningful than that.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455574)

    @sophia_marti --- *Gravity bridge has enabled the transfer of ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and Cosmos blockchain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455663)

    @TicoJohnny --- *They're built separately with their own chain as it stands now. IBC connects them together, in the near future there will be many different opportunities to develop tokens on other chains and have them connected with IBC. For example, smart contracts can be built with Juno and connected to IBC via Juno, and then exchanged on a DEX and then routed through the Cosmos Hub.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/455749)

    @TicoJohnny --- *They are separate sovereign blockchains built into the Cosmos Ecosystem, they aren't built onto or under the Cosmos Hub, they're built alongside it. We will potentially see value accrual with the release of Interchain Accounts, Interchain Security and the hub as a router next year.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454584)
