    @Bhaskar --- *I just what to know the anatomy of how the limited edition non-fungible tokens work on Solana.  Say, I have created a 3D Sword and I would like to mint 100 only out of 3D Sword file.  I am a little confused about how it works Solona SPL Token. Following is my idea on the workflow on how to achieve that. Please correct me if I am wrong and let me know the right way to do that.  1. Create a Token using spl-token create-token --decimals 0 (ex. this creates token with id TOKEN_ADDRESS_0001)  2. Mint the token using spl-token mint TOKEN_ADDRESS_0001 100 {SOME_OTHER_ADDRESS} (see 100 tokens i am minting)  3. Then disable further minting of that token using spl-token authorize TOKEN_ADDRESS_0001 mint --disable* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/869980)
