    @BBeniek --- *Does anyone know what will be approximately the APY for coming government period?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322556)

    @PingPongDiplomacy --- *It's because staking phase is over.  There's no more algorand allocated to staking rewards because it's governance phase now.  Which is 16% apy.  That was my understanding anyway* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322715)

    @Todd --- *Not everyone has the disposition that a moderator should have.  For many,  the power and position leads to abuse of said powers.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322525)

    @zentaurion --- *Is it really 0.81% APY now?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322680)

    @hostodi --- *I'm actually not sure which values they're using to get 0.81%. It could potentially be a math mistake? Either way, this is gonna be behind us soon(TM)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322687)

    @MackDenver --- *Hello Meta, it is up to coinbase to resume and process the transactions accordingly. A few other people have also reported similar issues. For now, all you can do now is wait for them to fix everything.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322764)

    @cryptomanmachine --- *Feel free to direct folks to this chat, admin, if they’ve been banned from the other one. The admin of the other one has been a bit of a loose cannon lately. We don’t ban anyone from AlgoFam though so no need to worry.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322523)

7. **chains, algorand, project**

    @patrick_crypto --- *As I recall, IBC is still having things use Tendermint and Atom..  so you can have ‘other’ chains make use of Cosmos/IBC. Algorand co-chains should just use Algorand consensus.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322213)

    @MackDenver --- *Hey Yozza, I'm not sure what are you talking about. Algorand and Stellar are different blockchain in the crypto space.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322448)

    @zZeoneo --- *Hi friends, I'm a big fan of the ALGORAND project and I've been studying a lot about it. I was recently researching more about the project and I heard some rumors that this will have a partnership with the Atom cosmos network, I was very interested in this news, because it seems this cosmos network is an old project but it has only just started to interconnect all blockchains . I would like to know from you, what is your opinion? Because if this partnership really happens, it will be fascinating to see our project interconnecting with all blockchains through this Atom cosmos project. What do you think?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322532)

    @zechuzu --- *sorry want to ask, is algorand creating sign on stellar?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322439)

    @patrick_crypto --- *I’ve never heard of Algorand being associated with Cosmos.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322546)

    @LifeMachine4 --- *Anyone know what the communication mechanism/protocol is between hypothesized Algorand Co-Chains? Also, given the fast finality properties of Algorand, are there any plans or talks for Algorand to utilize IBC as a standard interblockchain/co-chain communication protocol/standard?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/322212)
