10. **rug, ifo, lydia**

    @RealRager --- *‼️ Lydia Finance Red Flag. ‼️  Red flags in the following projects.  A few days ago I already reported that Everst was a scam and they were making a soft rug. Today they have been hacked they say, coincidence.  I also warn about AvaoFinance, ridiculous project without foundations and without product and that from the first moment they receive a liquidity that they keep and the price of the token from the first moment sinks.   But who is behind all this is Lydia Finance, which sooner or later will do the same. Make no mistake, every IFO is an opportunity for soft rug. They thought they found the goose that laid the golden egg, but they have really dug their grave. Run away from Avax Lions.  Run away from Lydia while you still can.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314414)

    @MarcJunqueras --- *Your team are doing a soft rug every IFO.  Your team didn't do nothing (KYC or multi-signature wallet when create IFO).

    @Yoopez --- *When you do an IFO you put your reputation on the projects you pushed. You have to act as an advisor So doing real research on the team you push and its skill. If it the same guy you mention, yeah they have a huge responsability on this rug* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314507)
