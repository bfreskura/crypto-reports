6. **horse, horses, game**

    @borsha3 --- *Can it be cared for like a normal horse? Is there feed for horse?#OLYSPORT* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/410151)

    @jimmy_olysport --- *Really no one is attempting to build out a game in the scope that we are envisioning.  Especially as a metaverse where virtual land is backed by real land - we are the first NFT game to do this globally.  But we do have other contenders in the horse racing eSport field.  However - again - this is like comparing the tip of the iceberg with the iceberg itself, as eSport horseracing is just 1 pillar of our gaming mechanics.  This article summarizes our competitive advantage well: https://sports.yahoo.com/horse-racing-metaverse-expands-startup-140009621.html* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/410056)

    @jimmy_olysport --- *With other NFT games: we are an esport, not a trending game. Horse Racing is like soccer, there are matches and tournaments happening all year round, and all around the world. The game will not close down until we have 1 gamer left in the game. We want to create a game that lasts for a long time to be able to make a bigger impact in disrupting the financial and real estate market.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/410055)

    @Darkness221 --- *Do you have any plan on expand your game content? Or it's just a horse racing game #OLYSPORT* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/410102)

    @Shah_HoneY --- *Nft games have barriers to entry. You can participate only when there is a minimum of nft. How much money do I need to participate in the game? #OLYSPORT* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/410100)

    @jimmy_olysport --- *This theme 'Horses of the Gods' is inspired by the top racehorses in Canada, where we're from. We’re currently in discussion with the owner of a winning racehorse in Canada about digitizing the horse’s image into an NFT and introducing him to the metaverse through Binance NFT. It will be a fun collaboration! More to come on this.   Once we have a good amount of supply of horses, we will start partnering with racecourses around the world to digitize the traditional horseracing industry. Collaborating with an NFT game like us can help them target a younger group of audience and diversify their revenue stream. Lots of racecourses are interested in this concept!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/410072)
