1. **defichain, cake defi, dfi**

    @Teo L. T. --- *Can I use DeFiChain swap DFI to dUSDT and transfer it to CakeDefi using DFI network? I am new to crypto. Actually I don’t know what is the different between USDT and dUSDT.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/156231)

    @Carlos --- *Will i ever be able to convert dfi to btc in the future ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/156495)

    @jollyboat --- *This is a problem with defichain system currently. I won't go into detail but basically the demand is more than the supply because of high APR for stock-dusd liquidity mining. There are some proposals to make dUSD closer to $1 but making the same for the stocks has some other problems* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/156217)

    @Kassius84 --- *No unfortunately not. You have to use the Ethereum Network for USDT. You could only use DeFiChain DEX to send USDT via DeFiChain Network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/156225)

    @Teo L. T. --- *Any exchange that can send USDT using DeFi Network instead of Ether? Address creation fee USD130 for Ether is too expensive.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/156224)

    @jollyboat --- *In general - while I do love cake - their withdrawal system is very chaotic. Sometimes it is very quick, sometimes it takes hours.
