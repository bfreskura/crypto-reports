1. **native, wmt, transactions**

    @glitch04 --- *If you don't have native assets then it will say you don't have assets to send, if you are just sending ada you have to put in the value you want to send less the transaction fee or it will fail* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/761965)

    @charlesaugu --- *Hi the minimum ada is a security measure to avoid spamming the blockchain with custom tokens, you are forced to put some ada with every native token you transfer, what I cannot tell you though it's what the exchange will do with that ada...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/761746)

    @Daz321 --- *How long will it be before we can send native tokens without having to send some ADA too?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/761984)

    @Ondrej22 --- *Hi guys, could anyone help?  I want to send WMT to an exchange from Daedalus wallet. There is also minimum 1,38 ADA needed to be send with WMT token as well. And additionally there is also estimated fee 0.18ADA. Why there is also need to send ADA with WMT as well? Will that ADA be "lost", or it arrive to destination address with WMT and it only costs that 0.18 ADA in fees? Or that 1,38 ADA will be return to my wallet after I send WMT?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/761729)
