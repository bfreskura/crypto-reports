    @Giorgio --- *Hi guys, I just opened a software version of solflare and something doesn't sound me so good, but of corse because I have no knowledge. At the moment of login, Instead of asking me for the password, it asks for the mnemonic, with no password, and then it shows me a list of solflare wallets based on the derivation path. Then I cannot select mine but just click on ACCESS and It goes directly to my own wallet. How does it associate it, since I haven t select it? Is there anything unsafe in this?

    @mahib45 --- *Hello 👋  This is NOT congestion on #Solana  network.  Please remember Binance is a centralized exchange, so when you request a withdrawal from Binance to  wallet, the Binance side will need to approve it, and the tx will NOT be recorded in the blockchain until Binance approved it. You may contact Binance tech support for more assistance ❤ Thank you so much!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/877676)
