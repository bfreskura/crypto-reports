6. **lp, lp tokens, liquidity**

    @xandercakes --- *Yes like I said, the 0.17% fees collected that go to LP holders are done by just adding the fees from the swap to the overall liquidity pool.   It's explained here in the docs page. If additional LP tokens are being sent to another address, that's something to do with the tokens contract code.  https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/pancakeswap-exchange/pancakeswap-pools* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2219127)

    @xandercakes --- *sort of, the screenshot i keep attaching explains it really well.  basically lets say there are 10 LP tokens representing 10 cake and 10 bnb  (1 LP token = 1 cake + 1 bnb)  if someone else trades 10 cake for 10 bnb , then another user trades 10 bnb for 10 cake, 0.017 cake and 0.017 bnb are taken from the two trades (the 0.17% trading fee). the 0.017 cake and 0.017 bnb are added to the overally liquidity pools so now there are 10.017 cake and 10.017 bnb after the two trades.  so each time there is a trade, the fees for liquidity providers are collected and added to the pool essentially making the LP tokens worth more.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2219147)

    @ClanMudhorn --- *Like that shouldn't have anything to do with that. PCS should be paying 0.17% of each txn to all LP holders based on their percentages. That has nothing to do with the extra slippage we charge people* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2219116)

    @ClanMudhorn --- *i think i am following now. so the liquidity pool is communally hodling what should be all the lp token payouts untill each individual lp provider pulls their liquidty, and only at that time do they see the yield they have earned* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2219142)

    @xandercakes --- *That isn't controlled by PCS, seems like that token probably has liquidity/transaction fees built into it's code that get sent to the contract owner and admin.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2219099)

    @rpoole69 --- *Gotcha, so let's say I supplied a LP pair and received 100 LP tokens, my portion of the .17% would be added to the 100 LP tokens I have?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2218455)

7. **claim, contract, claiming**

    @cryptXXXking --- *Contract was already found. Can't do anything. Claiming was turned off. Almost all was already taken* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2216952)

    @HAITIENLK --- *You can try claim. But, check fee before confirm, if 0.48bnb fee is error* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2217312)
