1. **iota, exchanges, binance**

    @millenium_earl2000 --- *Which exchange can u still withdraw iota* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301772)

    @navinhn --- *No , I m not choosing BEP20 in first place , but Binance has only BEP20 to transfer out of binance, and they suspended Real IOTA , if they don’t support then most of IOTA will b stuck on exchange* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301536)

    @navinhn --- *I think you are not understanding the technical properly, I know binance chain is completely different, but u r restricting wallet only for IOTA network, that’s wat I am saying* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301628)

    @sy-subrc --- *Every IOTA less traded on Binance, is a good IOTA. Hope that helps.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301923)

    @DF --- *So I think less one exchange working* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301971)

    @Yace --- *Is it possible to swap ada to iota ? For me you can only buy iota whith fiat money ( eur, dollars , .. )* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/302098)

2. **binance, withdraw, open**

    @SunnySide~ --- *yeah you know binance support is plenty helpful* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301444)

    @⠠⠵ Lucas! --- *Sorry. Basically CZ says binance is located where he is sitting in a given moment* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/302082)

    @NOMPike --- *Has anyone solved this problem yet? Those of us stuck on binance?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301916)

    @sy-subrc --- *Binance is only a rumor, isn’t it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301785)

    @Fold11 --- *So tomorrow we can withdraw from binance? Nice* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301769)

3. **firefly, wallet, transfer**

    @navinhn --- *Yes , that s 1 option, but if IOTA need thr token holders to participate then they also should support right , now major exchange like binance , huobi, Bittrex are not allowing them what the use, so what firefly can do from thr end is then can support BEP20 chain , if they don’t support others then how others will support thr token , in future if they want to transfer Bak to exchange to sell then again it’s going to create a problem,* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301591)

    @navinhn --- *If firefly support accepting BEP20 then it’s not a problem, because binance has opened withdrawal for IOTA in BEP20 , if IOTA want thr users to stake then they should enable this , else all binance IOTA coins will b stuck thr only* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301470)

    @Teleappa --- *Hi... Binance won't let me transfer to Firefly. It says that there is an issue with the IOTA network. Is it correct, is there a placer where I can by MIOTA to transfer to Firefly?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301791)

    @Mur --- *Hi I want transfer my iota token from etoro to fire fly wallet. Somebody knows how it works* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301760)

4. **staking, stake, time**

    @razali1984 --- *Should have at least resolve this issue before launching staking...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301398)

    @Tahmis --- *Well this was actually anticipated that something like this would happen when the actual staking starting is announced as everyone wants to withdraw at the same time* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301465)

    @sy-subrc --- *Time is running out? It’s actually more time until staking is live, than time passed, since pre-staking started.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301921)

    @sy-subrc --- *At least from the issue I once had, I can tell, that it might take a few hours for them (don't worry) and it's solved. You got some more days until staking starts :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301360)

    @sobroggi --- *I think early participants is actually the VCs etc. participating in ecosystem funding, but not participants of staking... https://blog.assembly.sc/assembly-fair-launch-token-distribution/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301735)

    @SunnySide~ --- *cheers guys also does it matter the size of your stake? it is ok to split into 2 wallets to stake or better to maintain in 1 wallet, or it doesnt matter?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301887)

    @sy-subrc --- *So it's more a specific problem to your account and not a general Bitfinexx issue* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301357)

    @sy-subrc --- *As far as I know and read the past few days: Bitfinex (tested myself), Bitpanda (sometimes disable for a few hours to refill their hot wallet) and BinanceUS* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301928)
