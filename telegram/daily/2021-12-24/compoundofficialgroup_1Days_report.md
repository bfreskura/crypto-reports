    @Clark042 --- *Yeah I totally agree - when people are sometimes beating that in a day, a 2x looks poor.

    @r_green21 --- *I will always emphasize that having a Long term mentality is key A get rich quick mindset makes one invest in shitcoins and tokens with no use case The potential Compound presents is huge.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/25042)

    @cyberlord21 --- *I think we've seen enough meme coins explode to the point where we can all understand the irrationality of these markets. I can accept that to some degree. In some way I even like it (though I would never invest in coins that have no use case - it stunts innovation). What DOES drive me crazy though, is when I see some of the older altcoins get bashed, and called "dead" because they haven't 10x'd in the last 12 months. Many of these coins have made impressive advancements with their protocols and infrastructure to better prepare for future adoption. Taking a proactive approach rather than a reactive approach.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/25204)
