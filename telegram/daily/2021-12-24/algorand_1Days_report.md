1. **stable, currency, price**

    @Ninvel --- *Hello, how are you? I am a junior developer of JAVA, I have got a project, the project was in tezos but I have another phiilosophy than the tezos comunity, my project is create a wallet for entreprises based in blockchains, this wallet would be desinged to be comfortable to use for physical and online stores, the problem with the tezos community is that my phylosophy is based on the international use of a “neutral” token (native token)  which must be stable (as a stablecoin but without being linked with another coin) Is the algo token designed to be long-term stable for use in international trade? thanks for the answer 😄* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324855)

    @Ninvel --- *The use of USD is a problem because it creates a dependency on the dollar, in addition, the commissions are paid in the native token* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324867)

    @Ninvel --- *I do not know if I explain myself well but the stability of a currency is a purely economic concept and is measured with the generalized changes in prices of products and services (inflation and deflation) the dollar is stable because its inflation is very small* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324883)

    @Ninvel --- *Well, thank you very much for answering me, but my interest is precisely not to use a stablecoin but rather that the native currency itself is stable, it just seems that in this algorand it does not fulfill my needs.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324888)

    @Martin --- *Life is not stable man. Everything changes except change. Your super stable-neutral coin is a honorable idea but that’s impossible to achieve in the real world.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324902)

3. **bot, picture, pic**

    @riqua21 --- *I know but I was wondering if race does play into perceptions about an account being a bot.  I'm sure it does but it's unconscious* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325172)

    @mrlovin --- *But if you see a Chinese women texting „hi“ it becomes obvious that it is a bot   If they would have a bot as profile pic I wouldn’t think so  Because a bot never says he is one* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325157)

    @mrlovin --- *If each not would have a picture of a white women but behave like a bot I would also doubt accounts which have such pictures  The same for black man and so on  Nothing racist here* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325169)

    @NightAlgorand --- *Welcome to Algorand Official channel 🙂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325138)

8. **language, set, group**

    @MackDenver --- *You should join the Spanish group  https://t.me/algorand_es* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325289)

    @patrick_crypto --- *Not an official group but you might try @algorand_price I have an automatic translator set up so assuming you have your language set in Telegram, it should automatically translate to/from  your native language and the channel’s set language (English)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325287)

    @Fmv --- *I can't speak in the other group* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325296)

    @Real_Noonlord --- *Thanks, language is not a problem for me but big deal for a lot of people* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325293)

    @MackDenver --- *There is no Korean group at the moment* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325336)

9. **metamask, dex, buy**

    @mrlovin --- *If I remember correctly you can’t swap directly on Metamask as well. You still have to go to a dex and just approve the transaction with Metamask. It works the same with algo. You go to a dex and approve the transaction with the algowallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325385)

    @mrlovin --- *What is the difference from using Metamask on a dex to using Algowallet on a dex?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325388)

    @AgenteBanderas --- *The difference is that by opening metamask I can buy eth through the same app, if I open algowallet I don't have the possibility to buy algo while staying in the same app, and i can't use apple pay or services like this* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325390)

    @AgenteBanderas --- *Well, metamask use transak to allow you to buy crypto, and it's much closer to being a sort of unique environment, now I use coinbase to buy algo, and it is much longer and not user friendly process in my opinion* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325386)

    @mrlovin --- *There is no Metamask in the Algorand world* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325301)

    @FereydoonAttar --- *Buy on Decoin now, so much easier and cheaper than use DEX* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325048)
