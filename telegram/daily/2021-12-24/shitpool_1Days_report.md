5. **1099, coinbase, taxes**

    @MoneroPal --- *Doesn’t matter what they are, what matters is enforcement, for which there is currently ZERO. The IRS is chronically underfunded and has so far not gone after any on-chain transactions. They’ve been doing the same old, go after under reporters that were issued 1099’s and did not pay their taxes. I doubt this will change in the near future, likely another 3-5 years minimum.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/711024)

    @wojackdegreate --- *You really think swaps aren’t taxable? 😂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/711019)

    @MoneroPal --- *Has nothing to do with feeling better. It has to do with the absolute retardation of reporting defi transactions to the IRS. There is absolutely no purpose whatsoever to doing so. If you’re converting crypto (asset) to fiat (USD) you will be presented wth a 1099-misc from whichever CEX. You owe taxes then.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/711018)

    @MoneroPal --- *If you’re cashing out a large sum you’ll be issued a 1099-misc for anything over $600 so you’ll need to pay “your fair share”* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/710997)

    @MoneroPal --- *lol taxes on when not selling to fiat on a CEX? ser…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/710985)

    @MoneroPal --- *No tax authority currently is analyzing the chain, certaintly not the IRS. They audit a total of 4500 partnerships per year and have been consistently defunded the past 15+ years. Not to mention the overhead and inability to prove wallet ownership reliably is still a major blocker. It will happen eventually, but not anytime soon. Many wallets, such as BlueWallet generate a new wallet address each transaction. Treat crypto as an asset, pay taxes when you sell that asset into fiat.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/710987)

6. **investing, liquidation, easiest**

    @pizza_dog --- *Also Pervy, borrow against your time for more mim to get time. You at least know the base time is compounding* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/710991)
