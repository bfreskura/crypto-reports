5. **real, win, real estate**

    @jakelabsgroup --- *Both works! Both of our platforms provides an easy starting point for blockchain and real estates aficinados, with the former one allowing investors to grow their wealth with real estate with just 100 USDT, and have a little fun with our WIN platform winning rewards.   LABS WIN Platform will be launched in the coming few weeks. So please do follow our social media channels and stay tunned!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356981)

    @juankaramoy --- *I has been a pleasant 45 min learning about the WIN Platform and your real estate investing platform. We just have a few questions here to wrap up our Q&A session for today* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356979)

    @jakelabsgroup --- *LABS has been focusing on digital Real Estate investment. The WIN Platform is an innovative and revolutionary idea to give back to the LABS supporters. With just $5 USD worth of LABS, participants can enter the raffle and try their luck.  The payoff of the winning ticket varies each day. Each sold ticket increases the prize pool. When a prize pool isn't won, the next round's prize pool will be accumulated from the previous round; the longer it's been since someone has won the jackpot, the larger the prize pool will be.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356964)

    @juankaramoy --- *Love the idea of giving more opportunity to the general mass to get involved in real estate investing via a fraction of its price point as we know real estate investing can cost a lot just to even get started with* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356962)

    @jakelabsgroup --- *Sure thing! LABS Group is a digital investment platform that provides access to fractionalized property ownership and enables the continuous trading of real estate assets-backed tokenized shares on a regulated security exchange.  We use blockchain technology and smart contracts to ensure complete transparency over a borderless ecosystem where property developers and investors can interact seamlessly and with unprecedented efficiency. So that people could invest in real estate projects in a fraction of its price point. Making real estate investment available for everyone.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356960)

    @jakelabsgroup --- *Whoa - that's a great question. The WIN platform is part of our ecosystem to create more utilities to our LABS token. While they could invest in real estate with a lower entry barrier, why not winning extra bonuses and rewards with WIN? It is also a perfect starting point for members to start their blockchain investment journey.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/356977)
