4. **whithraw**

    @AnalWhale666 --- *Yes but why make it 1 more  step, instead of just swap with cakes Dex on site, and then whithraw? That's my question* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/152126)

    @AnalWhale666 --- *Ofc u will have to use a exchange in the end for fiat, leta say binance, but what I don't get is why you can swap btc to everything but not from dfi back to btc and just whithraw, here cake defi wants me to make it o a third party then from there to a exchange, that's 2 extra steps* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/152128)

    @Jan-Niklas --- *Hello guys I've got a question: I have 35$ frozen in dfi staking. Also I have 75 dollar each in btc and dfi which I have set to liquidity mining. Both started on December 12th. Now I got a weekly report and it says: 10 cents staking 2 cents liquidity mining  Without calculating it as it is, why is the liquidity mining part so small? Since the % is double and the money more then 4 times as much, it should be like 80cents plus!  Anyone knows the reason for this?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/152238)

    @Cosmic88 --- *why dfi current cost around 50cents (usd) more to buy using credit card than using usdt?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/152188)

    @James --- *The increase in DFI price will make up the decrease in apy so you'll still have a decent income if you're an early adopter* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/151909)
