3. **dext price**

    @pityok --- *This will, we hope, greatly increase the burning rate of DEXT and its 100% deflationary character. Not only do we not increase inflation with that 1M from the DEXTShare but we buy into the market and burn everything received.  do we not increase inflation with that 1M from the DEXTShare - As i understand, Dextshare won't increase supply. But are there any other ways for increaasing supply? Maybe some early birds, private-seed sales etc? Or in means that supply of DEXT tokens NEVER will be more that today (and can be only less by burning)?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/311666)

    @stanes --- *For the monthly subscription it's 100$ paid in DEXT. So today the price of DEXT is 0.5$ then you need to send 200 DEXT. If next month when you want to renew the price is 1$ then you will have to send 100 DEXT. For the holding, it's 1k DEXT whatever the price of DEXT is. And we don't deduct anything from anyone wallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/312901)
