2. **day hour**

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *We didn't PROMISE an APY mate please get your statements correct you are saying this from day 1 you joined here, everyone aware that APY is dynamic and includes burns, we also explained how this works in  medium and also being shown under calculator>  Isn't there a way that it can be modified for example every minute automatically according to the real performance - No because we never know if the tokens will be burned or not because this was decided by governance proposal and this will be voted by investors and not from team* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229009)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *These burning happened in ETH farms V1 and these farms will be expired in 3 days* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229075)

3. **defillama**

    @timdyp --- *The point is that Coingecko is taking the TVL directly from Defillama, and by default Defillama is showing only our vaults, in order to see the rest of the pools the users must check ''Staking''. Also, we have made a request to Defillama to track the new pools, currently they track only the old pools. Coingecko is working on some updates to include all the pool stats, see attached email.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228960)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *We are seeing ppl complaining their deposited values are decreasing in value but that is not the case, ofcourse impermanent loss will be positive and negative in values but this is how yield farming works, we should see yield farming as longterm passive income plan and not a quick flip category* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228978)

    @Chris_Cryp --- *Your LP will keep decreasing until they manage to get more users into the farm. iDYP is sold everyday to pay rewards and new user deposits into the farms accounts for all the buying pressure for the iDYP price.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229126)

    @timdyp --- *Julien, please check my previous message scenario number 3: https://t.me/dypfinance/223784 At some point for the old pools the displayed APY was being earned, but these happened after at least 6 months since launch. Also, for the old pools at some point we had 0 IL, but again these happened after 7 months since launch. The yield farming is a long-term game, it is not something that you can flip daily. If you make the mistake to remove your liquidity in a bad moment, you can have losses caused by the IL. https://t.me/dypannouncements/541* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229014)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Please read about impermanent loss concept* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229043)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *You should read about impermanent loss and have a closer watch on market conditions, also already many times an explanation is given here in this group so please use search function and search for related keywords* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229111)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *The APY is dynamic yes but it stays in good range imo and from what I saw in V1 pools but again the APY depends on many factors* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229013)

    @timdyp --- *0.4 AVAX worth $33.75 deposited 5 days 18 hours ago to 3,30,60, and 90 days pools, and current market value is $34.20.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228970)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *The rewards you get depends on the APY and share % of the pools in above screen you can see so far earned rewards are ~2$ so in ~ 6 Days on 30$ deposit user earned 2$ multiple it to 10, 100, 1000 of deposited value so you got the math :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/228981)
