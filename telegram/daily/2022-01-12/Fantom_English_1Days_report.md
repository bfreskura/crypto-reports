4. **good, fees, poll**

    @exten_vision --- *Hello! Tell me please: is it worth waiting for FTM above 4 this year?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/628138)

    @KosherBacon --- *I apologize if this is the wrong room to ask this in, I just this minute joined here.    Admittedly I haven't followed anything going on with FTM, but have a little because of SoulSwap, and I have been staking my daily harvest from them every day.  So, my question, and I'm not complaining, so far FTM has been great, and the fees are very low.  However, in the last week or so, the fees have gone up about 10X.    For weeks and weeks my transfers (two a day) were about 0.012-0.019FTM.  The fees have been rising and are today  0.130FTM.   Is there a reason everyone except me is aware of?  lol  Will they come back down, or is this rise something we will see for a while?  Or ...?   I'm really just curious since the they are still really low, very reasonable.  But when fees go up 10X in 10 days, and no signs of stopping, it has me curious.  Perhaps it has something more to do with SoulSwap's side, but that seems odd.  Any education on this would be appreciated, thanks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/628048)

    @dominikbolena --- *Hey guys, are here some ftm / blockchain professionals?  I have a general question about ftm / tomb.  We all think, the demand and transactions on the Ftm blockchain will raise significantly.  So my question is: will in this case also the transaction cost and speed increase dramatically? Does ftm habe than a similar problem, like other chains?  Or is there any solution planned in such a case? Thanks for helping :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/628661)
