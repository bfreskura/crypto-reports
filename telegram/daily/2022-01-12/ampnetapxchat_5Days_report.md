1. **aapx, token, greenpeace**

    @<UNK> --- *This is due to the fact that AAPX unlocks linearly and sites like CMC or CoinGecko have "unlock date" which we cannot use, cuz appx is unlocking every moment instead of a set date  But anyone can check circ. supply/max supply here -  https://claim.ampnet.io/app/dist/index.html* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36149)
