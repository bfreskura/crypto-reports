1. **support, contact, email**

    @fabioandreatta --- *Yes we do! Reach out to our CS if you have found something, we have rewards of up to 30,000 USD* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163485)

    @gilldog --- *So true, "thanks for your feedback!Noted" - What a joke! It would take them a couple minutes to make a banner on top of the website. More profitable for them to have your BTC locked on their platform so they keep it shush and have the guts to reply that they told everyone 🤦👎 Lost a ton of trust on Cake after this one. I hope they will show that it was a genuine mistake and make it right for all of us* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163242)

    @Misko --- *he has already contacted me(the moderator) about the issue* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163104)

    @gilldog --- *Again, you need to be more transparent and put banners on top of the page. A Telegram announcement was not enough for something this big. Some people don't check telegram very often nor they continuously click on the withdrawal or deposit tab. You brag transparency all over yet this massive issue had very minimal exposure and it keeps being the same way despite the community complaining. Cake should issue a DFI reward to everyone for their lack of actions taken to inform the community of this. You need a better way to let everyone know. Heck some people still don't know* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163218)

    @BerndMack --- *there is a question on twitter in exactly this direction:  https://twitter.com/cakedefi/status/1480863995322060800* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163463)

2. **swap, dusd, possible**

    @Paulius --- *I have tried swaping DFI to BTC. On CakeDefi app.   And i get the message that swaps are only allowed to DFI. So i get rewards in DFI crypto currency, but can not swap DFI to other cryptos.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163277)

    @Milad --- *Sorry I meant toke. It is not possible to swap anything onto dex. And it is not possible to send btc via dex* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163700)

    @fabioandreatta --- *You can use the DEX (light wallet) to swap, there are some services like dfx.swiss and Bitrue that are and always have been open during the period. Kucoin is still under maintenance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163267)

    @DmgBautista --- *You'll need to buy DUSD with DFI and then convert a part of that DUSD into the token you wish. After that, just join a pair of DUSD-dToken in a LM pool. Rewards will be majority in DFI and a small part in DUSD as well as the other dToken in the pool, coming from fees* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163392)

6. **deposit, address, usdt**

    @DmgBautista --- *I'll try and ask it someone on the backend can check. At Cake, any withdrawal equal or bigger than 10k$ is manually reviewed without exception  but if you inform that it was efectivelly withdraw, then it needs to be seen.   If you wish, you can also make a support ticket for the below email  https://cake.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163443)

    @gilldog --- *It is awesome that you guys answer, but the issue is still there and people are still losing money over it which is frustrating. As mentioned before, lots of us have our deposit address already saved on other platforms. Most of us do not log into Cake every time to copy the deposit address one more time, making the positioning of the banner useless. I personally have received no email from cake regarding this. My account was active but no funds were in there yet so im guessing I was not on that address list. I have been doing quite a bit of research into cake, I had the BTC address already saved on the other platform where I keep my crypto. In the new year I finally felt confident, the address was already saved and I pressed the trigger. I AFTER logged into cake to check the deposit was succesfull. boom. was succesful and everything  was there. So THEN i go use it and only then i see the banner. Hope this is clear for everyone now. At this point didn't even start using cake and I find myself at loss of transaction fees and BTC I can't withdraw back unless i waste even more in BTC fees.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163280)

    @mikelfilko --- *ETH withdrawal fee is in fact 0.015ETH instead of 0.0015, I have been misled by the information on the cake website. Please fix this @cake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163153)
