1. **metapool, meta, stnear**

    @GeorgePro1 --- *1. MetaPool (https://metapool.app/dapp/mainnet/meta/#)  distributes the tokens proportionally to the validators, so no worries which validator to choose. 2. You still get ~11% APY on your $NEAR, and withdraw NEAR whenever you want without waiting (with fee). 3. On top of that you get MetaPools $META token payed out daily 4. You get stNear which can be used on other DeFi applications such as app.ref.finance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/282390)

    @iamkemoo --- *You can stake you stNEAR on DeFi protocols such as Ref Finance (https://app.ref.finance/), or use OIN Finance (https://near.oin.finance/) to mint $nUSDO and stake the $nUSDO to get $META and $OIN tokens as rewards.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/283205)
