    @zhengshui1977 --- *What are the requirements for a standard member now? The homepage says to pay $100 in DEXT/monthly subscription, -or -1,000 DEXT/hold. It says yes in the app 1. Hold 1.000 DEXT in the wallet 2 - Transfer 278 DEXT from your current wallet to 0x469d342e4f3d9ffbedca2e2ca8ab268a6fe973c3* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323436)

    @zhengshui1977 --- *OK, thanks. This tool is pretty easy to use. If I only need to hold 1000, I am willing to buy it. I probably wouldn't consider it if it had to be paid monthly, thanks for the help* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323441)
