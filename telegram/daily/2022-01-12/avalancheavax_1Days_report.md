7. **google, avax wallet, avax**

    @Alp --- *When you search as "Avax Wallet" on Google evrytime different scammer web pages appearing with Google Advertisement at the first line. They are imitating the official avax wallet page. If you enter the page, they are stealing your 24 mnemomic phase key.  How they can give the Google ads? Why dont the Avalance team talk with Google to prevent scamming from there. Lots of people are losing the keys and funds. Please be careful.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/321452)

    @Alp --- *It is really strange. Yesterday i have search so many times as Avax Wallet. The web pages at the first line is everytime changing. They are uaung different names.
