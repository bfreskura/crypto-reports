1. **pancakeswap, pancake, price pancakeswap**

    @Ayilaran1 --- *This has happened many times, I tried to move my coins from wallets to wallets, I have created many wallets and deleted many wallets, yet this guy would go there and remove all the coins in droves as if there is no security at all. This was why I pleaded yesterday with pancakeswap community to help me get a secure way to transact without being exposed to the scammers. And today it's started again, pls I need to break free from them. Is there any way, I have flashed my mobile device twice.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2264113)

3. **cake, supply, btc**

    @Salman --- *CAKE price is around 10.90$ and current total circulating supply is 257 Million. One  year ago when the price was around 40$ it had  total circulating supply of around 92 million CAKE.   The total circulating supply of CAKE has increased from around 92 m to 257m in roughly one year time frame. I also noticed that devs of pancake are constantly selling CAKE( which you can check on BSC scan that the top wallets are selling continuously) If the circulating supply was still same as of last year which was 92m then (current market cap 2.8 divided by total circulating supply 92m 2,800,000,000/92,000,000 = 30.43$ . In short if they wouldn’t had increased the circulating supply then the price would still be around 30$ today.   Good projects always burn the supply instead of increasing it and selling it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2261686)

    @Palendran --- *And will cake ever go again over 40$? Its possible?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2262806)

    @Jhonbist --- *The initial price of the cake is less than $1 so it's possible it could be as high as $500* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2262278)

    @odinpodin --- *Why is the cake inflation just increasing? The price will just go to 0 at this rate.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2265960)

    @TapaTapppp --- *Yes i just created my first metamask wallet. And someone said that cake is going to 100 dollars. I dont know if it is true or whether this project is legit or a scam. So i came to telegram to ask* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2261778)

    @hmmmm1236 --- **Not a financial advise* Cake has a good chance to hit 40$ in a year or 2, current price is ≈10.5. do your own study's and explores+* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2261678)
