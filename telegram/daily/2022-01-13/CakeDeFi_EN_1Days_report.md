7. **swap, dex, dbtc**

    @Milad --- *Sorry I meant toke. It is not possible to swap anything onto dex. And it is not possible to send btc via dex* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163700)

    @DmgBautista --- *With DFI, you cannot join the LM pool. My best advice, place a swap from DFI into dBTC. CAKE will place the swap under your name in the defichain dex, no need for you to send your coins there. However, it may be a bit slower than sending to dex, making the swap and return to Cake. However, more userfriendly :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164421)

    @DmgBautista --- *If you have BTC, you can enter LM, you can use simple mode and Cake will split your BTC in half. Half will be wrapped into dBTC and the other half turned into DFI, and the the pool is filled with that entry :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164416)

    @DmgBautista --- *You can therefore place te swap request and as soon and finished, you'll receive BTC in ypur Cake account. After that, just use therefore normal mode (since you'll have both coin pairs after turning half your DFI into BTC) and join the pool :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164435)

    @jfdsxr --- *Can is swap my Dusd on defi cake for DFI tokens? And then send them to an exchange?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163602)

    @Siva --- *Is it possible to swap DFI for dbtc on cake or should I do that with the Defichain wallet?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164411)
