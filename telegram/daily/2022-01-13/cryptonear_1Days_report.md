    @HODL_R --- *if I have the 24 word recovery phrase for my Lesger, will I be able to recover my NEAR assets for sure even if the Ledger device is lost or stolen,  is there a way to test this practically? Can I safely have 2 copies of the NEAR wallet secured by the same Ledger at the same time on 2 different machines to test this* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/283515)

    @Kripto_Raptor --- *but to integrate that ledgers keys into another device (ledger kinda thing) may require expertise* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/283525)

    @Kripto_Raptor --- *every data stored on the blockchain same with your ledger 😊, if you have that matching key you dont need that specific ledger device* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/283523)

    @Kripto_Raptor --- *but since the recovery option with Ledger requires you to connect your ledger device and sign it there https://wallet.near.org/sign-in-ledger as you can clearly see here* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/283542)

4. **metapool, meta, ref**

    @GeorgePro1 --- *1. MetaPool (https://metapool.app/dapp/mainnet/meta/#)  distributes the tokens proportionally to the validators, so no worries which validator to choose. 2. You still get ~11% APY on your $NEAR, and withdraw NEAR whenever you want without waiting (with fee). 3. On top of that you get MetaPools $META token payed out daily 4. You get stNear which can be used on other DeFi applications such as app.ref.finance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/284041)

    @iamkemoo --- *You can stake you stNEAR on DeFi protocols such as Ref Finance (https://app.ref.finance/), or use OIN Finance (https://near.oin.finance/) to mint $nUSDO and stake the $nUSDO to get $META and $OIN tokens as rewards.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/283205)
