    @GULUacityinUganda --- *jeremy hogan reckoned it was filed jointly by both parties (they agreed to the extension)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039074)

    @EML1993 --- *Relax, a motion to extend discovery is allegedly going to be filed according to the reporter. It’s not clear who will file the motion.  Is it the sec, or ripple, or both of them? And assuming they file the motion, the judge still needs to rule whether or not to grant the motion to extend. At any rate, let’s wait and see if a motion to extend is really going to be filed at all.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039066)

    @EML1993 --- *Yes, he is of the view that it will be filed jointly but not yet certain. We have to wait and see if a motion is indeed going to be filed at all.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039075)
