6. **liquidity, queue, projects**

    @Abed --- *well, team expenses are redeemed by dumping link token on the market and there's no equal demand.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363552)

    @Bruce_OpenSwap --- *In this day and age, they can either find VC’s capital, which is not super easy, or sell their project tokens, which is not exactly a good move for various reasons.   The OpenSwap Booster Queue is applicable for projects seeking to raise additional funding without the risk of market price impacts.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364023)

    @Bruce_OpenSwap --- *And, of course, the (less exciting) Pegged Queue - Which is designed to allow projects to stabilize stablecoin with a target peg.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364004)

    @Bruce_OpenSwap --- *5. Bond Marketplace - At OpenSwap, we also enable projects to take back control of their token liquidity with a LP purchase program by offering LP holders a discount on vested project tokens in exchange for LP tokens. By owning the LP tokens, the project teams can be rest assured that liquidity stays in the AMM pool, unlike traditional farming approaches where liquidity gets removed once the reward tokens dry up.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363995)

    @Bruce_OpenSwap --- *4. Our fourth key offering is - Liquidity as a Service (LaaS). OpenSwap is building up a network of stablecoin partners to offer up liquidity as a service for early stage projects who often face the challenge of securing funds to provide the liquidity for their project tokens. By offering fixed yields for stablecoin holders, project teams would only be required to provide project tokens for the AMM pairs while stablecoin fixed yield seekers contribute the other side of the pair. This offering will enable projects to utilise their funds towards BUIDLing their projects.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363994)

    @Bruce_OpenSwap --- *1. On-chain Private Sales Offering - which is a service enabled by our OpenSwap Booster Queue, a technology that allows projects to facilitate private sale rounds, and providing an end-to-end on-chain solution including token purchase, vesting schedules, and secondary market for vested tokens.   The OpenSwap Booster Queue is applicable for projects seeking additional funding without the risk of market price impacts. Projects may choose to whitelist the offering and offer guaranteed buybacks to participants to instill even more confidence in the project during unstable market conditions.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363986)

7. **nfts, link, support**

    @Linkederic --- *Chainlink is not a blockchain, so you wouldn't launch an nft marketplace "on Chainlink"  Relevant articles: https://blog.chain.link/what-is-chainlink/  https://blog.chain.link/blockchains-oracles-similarities-differences-synergies/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363163)

    @BilliCasper --- *Is getting nfts possible with chainlink* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363367)

    @CeeZ --- *Does the chainlink network support NFT's (soon(?))* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363143)

    @CeeZ --- *As eth nft market place, link marketplace? Link-xxx as erc-xxx ?  The smart contract allows nfts on eth. Will link support link-nft?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363160)

    @Linkederic --- *That said, Chainlink can be used to generate NFTs that rely on external data, or even dynamic NFTs that update based on changing real world data! as in this https://twitter.com/Smart_Contract/status/1480727778496598021* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363164)

    @BrapreetLadysMan --- *About Chainlink NFT support I just remember the tweet from the Sports Ball player* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363154)

8. **vrf, chainlink vrf, bridge**

    @Joypokkamol --- *In just a few moments, we will have a Community Q&A with OpenSwap who recently announced that it integrates Chainlink VRF to Ensure Fair Randomness for OpenSwap’s Bridge Troll NFTs https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1478352303832944651?s=20* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363971)

    @Joypokkamol --- *In just a few moments, we will have a Community Q&A with KAKA NFT World who recently announced that it integrates Chainlink VRF to power a fair and transparent gameplay https://kakanft.medium.com/kaka-nft-world-integrates-chainlink-vrf-to-power-a-fair-and-transparent-gameplay-4f304b88edca.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363403)

    @Bruce_OpenSwap --- *After careful consideration, our team decided to go with Chainlink VRF because it is supported by your time-tested oracle infrastructures and secured through generation and on-chain verification of cryptographic proofs. With your VRF, our participants are provided with automated and publicly verifiable assurance  on-chain that our Bridge Trolls generated are truly random.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364011)

    @kakanft001 --- *KAKA has integrated Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) on the Binance Smart Chain mainnet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363433)

    @Joypokkamol --- *It is fascinating to see KAKA NFT World Integrates Chainlink VRF* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363429)

    @kakanft001 --- *By integrating the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, we now have access to a tamper-proof and auditable source of randomness needed to generate results of all lucky draws that ensure the fairness of the gameplay in every event.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363434)

9. **build, defi, near future**

    @Bruce_OpenSwap --- *In the near future, we will be dabbling into DeFi 2.0 in particular liquidity as a service (LaaS). Our first move would be our latest Booster Queue which we will be rolling out very soon. A big problem in the IDO space is that a project might run out of resources before they can finish the development of their potentially brilliant protocol.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364022)

    @Bruce_OpenSwap --- *So yeah, we have a few things planned for as our upcoming milestones.   We are expanding to other chains to provide our services to DeFi users there. We are holding a governance poll deciding which chain we should deploy on next with the choices being Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche. Regardless of the outcome, I’m sure it’s going to be exciting.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364020)

    @Bruce_OpenSwap --- *On top of our base-layer technologies, our key offerings includes the following:-* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363985)

    @Bruce_OpenSwap --- *At the core, my team’s strength is technology, however, we’ve been aiming to build up a community of talent that crosses boundaries of technology, finance, marketing, and more through the many partnerships we have developed and continue to build. We hope to attract more developers and contributors to our team through participation events such as hackathons that ultimately build up the DeFi community.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363975)

    @Joypokkamol --- *What’s next on your project’s roadmap that we may expect in the near future?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364018)
