2. **staking, governance, rewards**

    @iamaturtle123 --- *Hi guys, programmer here new to the Blockchain. I am thinking of creating a tax preparation app for yieldly where I put in an address and it spits out a list of interactions with the yieldly staking app along with the price of yieldly on the day of the transaction. My question is how should I query the blockchain? It looks like the algo explorer api would do what I want, but I also see that is deprecated and frowned upon. Would I have to run my own algo node to do this, or is there another api I should use?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332161)
