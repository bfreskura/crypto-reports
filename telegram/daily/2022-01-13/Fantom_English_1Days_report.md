    @Janevietani --- *Helpful tip:   if you want a cheaper alternative than bridging ftm and paying eth gas From binance(US) ,crypto.com or kucoin, get BNB and withdraw as BNB BEP20, then use https://spookyswap.finance/bridge To bridge BNB BEP20 to BNB Fantom Then use spookyswap to swap BNB Fantom to FTM  You will need ftm gas for transaction. Use the faucet https://www.mentasuave01-tools.com/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/629131)

    @Mcjig --- *Helpful tip: if you want a cheaper alternative than bridging ftm and paying eth gas From binance or kucoin, get bnb and withdraw as bep20, then use https://swap.spiritswap.finance/#/bridge To bridge bnb bep20 to bnb fantom. Then use spiritswap to swap bnb to ftm spiritswap bridge will also send you 0.4 ftm for gas when bridging (edited)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/629265)

    @Mcjig --- *Everyone, understand when sending ftm or any other token to and from a exchange. You have erc20  (eth network) You have bep2 and bep20 (binance network) You have mainnet (opera) (ftm network)   These 3 networks are not compatible with each other   YOU have to use one of our bridges to send tokens from FTM network to a different network.   THIS also inludes all tokens other than FTM including usdc,btc,eth, etc.....   You cannot send ftm mainnet to a erc20 or a bsc address without a bridge* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/629522)
