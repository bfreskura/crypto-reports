6. **number, price, 50**

    @gonubie --- *Yea its exploded my portfolio and staking is 300-400% for now* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/716261)

    @Gregoranus --- *Yeah I imagine not. The reason it went to around $50 probably was that was roughly where the price of DOT was at the time of staking, the reward was a little over 1:1 so those that sold near the top just got there original stake back at least, if they bought lower then bonus. Free ride from here. My average is around $35 so I didn’t even need to catch anywhere near the top.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/716260)
