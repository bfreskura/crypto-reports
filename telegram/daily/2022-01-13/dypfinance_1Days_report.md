1. **proposal, community, buy**

    @WatermelonNoia --- *I think there should be a gDYP token that has no monetary value but is linked to any DYP held anywhere (wallet, contract etc) by an individual.  This enables your community to fully utilise DYP for its purpose of generating wealth in the ecosystem and having access to governance token for DAO actions.  I for one have all my DYP locked in contracts. I want to vote, and yes could buy more DYP or claim some (taxable event) but this would be insignificant compared to what i currently hold if available as a gDYP as suggested.  Community - would we vote on this if this was made into a proposal?   What is the communities view on this?  @timdyp* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/238917)
