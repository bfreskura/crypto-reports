    @Nazhadi57 --- *Is there any IL for the farms?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237290)

    @shinigamikami --- *I’m in all farms too and down especially on BSC buyback(heavily down on that one) but I believe all these are in the short term* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237459)

    @Craig --- *Thanks for the article. Back to my original post - what's the short description on how IL fluctuates? I have a hard time understanding why it would hit a 100% at any time and what would cause it to improve back.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237491)

    @Craig --- *We're comparing apples to oranges. I'm farming and you're staking, so different IL's taking place.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237482)

    @hemanrock --- *Usually all types Farming do have IL. here is a clear explanation about IL https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained it can be improved when the both assets increased* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237497)

    @shinigamikami --- *Give it time mate, you’re not that down due to the rewards and IL is only temporary. My $6k deposit on bsc buyback peaked $19k now it’s barley $1500 but I’m not really bothered cause I plan to leave it there for at least 5 months* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237472)

    @shinigamikami --- *No, I was talking about a different product “BUYBACK” there your deposit is used to buy 75% iDYP and 25% DYP and they’re staked* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237486)

    @Nazhadi57 --- *Hi, can I ask if I deposit my token (eg AVAX) in farms and withdraw later, will I still get back the same token or some will be converted to DYP?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237282)

    @Nazhadi57 --- *So 25% of my deposit is converted to DYP? I can’t get back 100% AVAX?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237285)

    @Craig --- *You said the value is now $1500 and your deposit was $6K. That's a 75% drop.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237492)

    @fightinamish --- *Got it reinvested, thank you.  It does a weird thing (especially on iPhone) where you click idyp allocation and it goes to the page for 1-2 seconds and then snaps back to connect wallet.  I can access everything on site through my phone except for idyp.  Then on mac I can get it to work but after multiple attempts.  Nothing major, just an fyi* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237452)

    @fightinamish --- *Idyp allocation page isn’t working on my desktop (won’t load, unable to see balance or reinvest).  Any work being done internally?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237449)

7. **claim, fees, max fees**

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *This is from Metamask estimation and as said this is Max fees that will be charged and that is based on ETH network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237425)

    @Craig --- *This is the estimated fee to claim 386 DYP. If I click on 'claim' WETH, the estimated fee is $35. It makes no sense.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237428)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Try completing the transaction the actual cost will be less of what is shown the Metamask estimates max fees* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237420)

    @Craig --- *It shows the same GWEI amount for both claims, but the dollar amount is 10x higher. It makes no sense.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237419)

    @Craig --- *Why is it to claim DYP rewards the amount of fees are 10x what it is to claim your underlying asset? So, if to claim WETH costs $50, to claim DYP costs $500.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237416)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *The metamask shows Max fees the actual charge will be less, I see that ETH nework is congested the GWEI is ranging upto 200 so this might be reason* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/237418)
