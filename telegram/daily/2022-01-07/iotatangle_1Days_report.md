5. **buy, market, trading**

    @Anna --- *It's time to change your trading strategy and learn something that will deliver steady long-term returns in the face of unknown market changes. When the market dives, you can easily be exposed to hedging risks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/306137)

    @ElmettS96 --- *Same opinion, in this group there are too many people that want to make profit and to be rich as soon as possible without thinking, instead of thinking to a real utility of a token in long time (and accumulate it in this situation) they are influenced by the price and by the rumors of the cryptospace and buy whatever shitcoin people told them to buy (and usually their fund sunks)... TIME PEOPLE TIME* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/306100)
