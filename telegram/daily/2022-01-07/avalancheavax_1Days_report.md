8. **000, minimum, avax staked**

    @ghostcarapace3 --- *And on a bigger question of MEV, I am of the understanding that the larger a pool of avax is staked behind a single validator, that validator validates more transactions.... is this right? If so, does avax have a maximum size amount for validators to prevent centralization? I am less worried about 51% than I am about frontrunning transactions.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/320400)

    @ramadhan_tiba --- *Not farm, but stake singlr side , just avax* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/320360)

    @ghostcarapace3 --- *Question... is there a technical or game theory purpose to not allowing a lower minimum number of avax to be staked? At some point, avax will be split among a larger number of people hodling it, and the average avax wallet may only be 5-10 avax in size. Let us for the sake of argument assume avax reaches a price of $3000 in 5 years. However, the average investor continues to hold less than $15,000 in investments (10,000 with generous inflation) In addition, the total distribution of avax amongst investors flattens out. Under such a condition, less of the total supply of avax can be staked, leading to more avax sloshing around on the market, leading to lower prices. However, I am more worried about the centralization of the market in such a scenario. let's say a whale comes along with 200,000 avax, and starts to use it to stake maliciously, or to try to extract value from the trades of other users (front running via block production) Am I missing something here? Isn't it more healthy to have the minimum amount stakeable by market participants to be as low as technically possible, and the cost of running a node to also be as low as technically possible to include as much of the network as possible in the protocol? Having an arbitrary minimum limit might exist for a good technical reason i am not aware of, but if it is does not exist, then long term when avax increases in price beyond what most people can afford, does this create a situation where the consensus is gerrymandered in favour of the whales?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/320399)

    @ramadhan_tiba --- *does anyone here know where to staking single side AVAX?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/320350)

    @Cofidiss --- *For staking we need 25a avax?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/320598)
