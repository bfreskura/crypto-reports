    @John --- *Guys does anyone know how to transfer from NEAR WALLET ---> exchange. The wallet insists on a 64 character address but the exchanges provide deposit address with less characters. BEP20 (BSC) address - which is not 64 characters so there does not seem to be any way to transfer from NEAR Wallet to an exchange - I'm sure there's an obvious answer here but I can't see it - thanks in advance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/279162)
