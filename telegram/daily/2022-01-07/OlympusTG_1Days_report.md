    @nfwaple --- *you can DCA any project friend* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143882)

5. **wsohm, gohm, swap**

    @Ap0l1o --- *The migration is so that you change from the old contracts to the new ones. The new ones allow you to take your Ohm multi chain and avoid high fees on eth. By migrating, you can bridge your gOhm to another network and sell it there later on for fees that are less than a dollar.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/142981)

    @nfwaple --- *correct, but get gOHM not the wsOHM, gOHM is the v2 token, wsOHM is the old version* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143897)

    @dbish4 --- *I can get more gOHM if I swap on traderjoe though. Why not do that?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143329)

    @themannyster --- *I see thanks. I kept seeing gOHM and was wondering what the difference was. So what happens if you get wsOHM on avax will it become worthless if you dont migrate to gOHM?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143903)

    @dbish4 --- *Should I trade wsOHM for gOHM on traderjoe or do migration from wsOHM to gOHM on Olympus website?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143325)

    @samboan --- *Ok so i swapped to gohm. Is that al i need to do now?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143087)

6. **wallet, send, isnt**

    @willyc --- *It keeps getting disconnected by wallet connect* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/142870)

    @nfwaple --- *do you still see them through your wallet?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143170)

    @nfwaple --- *I think you have been hacked friend, if metamask says 0.. if you want you can send me the transaction link in my dm, I can help you to have a look. No need to send if you're uncomfortable with it though* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143175)

    @QTmightbehere --- *New to crypto but can’t any reflections or anything* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/142937)

7. **stake, staked, gohm staked**

    @Nostress04 --- *gOHM, it's v2 and already staked.  Don't buy v1, since you'll have to convert it to gOHM, paying network fee for conversion* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143510)

    @samboan --- *So after i buy gohm what do i do? And which is better. To buy gohm or stake manually* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143026)

    @cdp279 --- *Yes Ser, just hold in your wallet. it is wrapped, not staked. gOhm = index x price* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143476)

    @cdp279 --- *If you buy gohm direct you will never need to stake. It’s a wrapped token that has the staking effect built in* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144045)

    @Tony --- *Whats the difference between zap and stake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144033)

    @nfwaple --- *no, gOHM is already staked, you're just going to the website to visualise your holding, you should be able to see something under Staked Balance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143104)

8. **ohm, gate, hotbit**

    @JRL1337 --- *Ok once you unwrap the box how do you sell the ohm cannot see in wallet but can see on ohm app. Must be doing something wrong.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/142960)

    @nfwaple --- *you should still see your staked OHM in Metamask even if you haven't migrated. I would suggest you to use Debank, then look up your own wallet address, no need to connect if you're uncomfortable with it. Then go to History, and you can see where your OHM has gone* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143180)

    @stacyd82d --- *What happened to the zap function on the ohm dashboard   I knew it was not running but now the option is gone?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/142895)

    @Zhtjook --- *I deposited ohm V2 in gate two days ago, but they only support ohm V1 at present. How can I get my token back?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/143661)
