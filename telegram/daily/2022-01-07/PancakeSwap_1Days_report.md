    @alexsoh1 --- *Yup. Few hundred lines of codes with just one line to transfer the fund to the scammer wallet.   And they will ask you to execute Action function of their contract to trigger the transfer of funds.   All YouTube tutorials for front running/snipping are all scams. Scammers usually create multiple YouTube accounts to leave excellent comments on their YouTube posting.  No one will post real front running codes on YouTube 😁. So beware of scams.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2253454)
