    @sravan906 --- *0.3 algo reward 😂😂 lol what is this . Is this a reward* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330393)

    @kramercrypto --- *You could move your rewards to a separate wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330543)

    @Grabari --- *Seems like a kind of task for software developers, to implement special type of tx for withdrawing (0A to your wallet to collect rewards and then send XA to other wallet). If done in <4s (later 2.5s) there should be no additional microA in rewards. Or maybe there are already an option for it (sending only the wallet Algorands)? 🤔 Maybe admins could answer it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330552)

    @qweraar --- *hi may i ask will i get more rewards by holding more algo in my wallet？* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330165)

    @eloquentplatypus --- *When I make a withdraw from my Algo wallet it includes rewards e.g. I send 300 ALGO and there are 100 rewards it will send 100 ALGO rewards + 200 ALGO from wallet. This is absurd. A tax nightmare. It's putting me off ALGO.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330541)

    @NightAlgorand --- *Hi Mental , how are you today? 🙂  Yes, it will be lower. If there are 30 billion Algo committed in Governing Accounts for that quarter, their rewards will be 70.5m/30b% = 0.24% for every Algo committed for the quarter, corresponding to annualized 0.94%, to be added to the return from participation rewards, totaling 1.94%* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330187)

9. **algofi, avlo, liquidated**

    @MuratArkan --- *Why didn't algo intervene in the November 18 manipulation? this date has done great damage to this project. If you want to be a big coin, you will interfere with these manipulations, you will not allow them? Who sold the upgrade at that time? algo should explain it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330181)
