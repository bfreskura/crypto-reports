    @kiwicryptoT --- *It is very easy…the hard part was getting the listing in the 1st place.  It shouldn’t be hard to deposit CNTs   And even without the CEX issues, REVU app crapped itself today and deleted a lot of users wallets and won’t let them restore as severs overloaded* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/766561)
