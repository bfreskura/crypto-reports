1. **dextools, dext, update**

    @MonkeySuit --- *so in my opinion, dext token is a good buy/hold, I think there are big things coming for the platform, if you hold 100k you can get into the VIP group and participate in venture deals.  Other than that I would get into metaverse or p2e focused tokens early.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/315780)
