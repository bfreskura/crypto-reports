    @Dtt --- *So the price of 1 Ohm can never drop below 1 Dai?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/129716)

    @Dtt --- *What happens if I buy let’s say 10 Ohm for $4K and the price of 1 Ohm drops to $40? Wouldn’t I lose a lot of money despite the high Apy? I mean the price volatility makes it pretty risky* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/129725)

    @RockyT31 --- *$94,000 is ohm from poor victims* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/129620)

4. **bonding, assets, bond**

    @Poopoo (never dm first & don't dm me) --- *from bonding, the bonder provides LP token to the protocol* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/129665)

    @Poopoo (never dm first & don't dm me) --- *yes let's say a bonder pays 400 DAI to mint 1 OHM through bonding, the protocol only need to make sure that 1 DAI doesn't get used, the protocol can use 399 to either mint 399 more OHM, or partially used to mint OHM then use the rest for yield generating activities* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/129708)

    @Poopoo (never dm first & don't dm me) --- *there was probably some bootstrapping event at the beginning, then yes, bonding to get assets, and assets in the treasury generates more assets as well, and partnership with other protocols and they provided the Olympus with some equity* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/129513)

    @Poopoo (never dm first & don't dm me) --- *LP tokens so yes fees, and treasury strategy down the line too, so that the treasury can make more from the assets we have* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/129516)

    @Poopoo (never dm first & don't dm me) --- *but because of the bonding mechanism, new tokens are issued to the bonders, and the bonders dilute the stakers, but they bring in more assets to the protocol, so there needs to be a balance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/129535)

    @Poopoo (never dm first & don't dm me) --- *would be only a portion of it, at the moment some assets are just sitting there doing nothing, so the protocol will need to work out a strategy for the treasury asset* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/129560)
