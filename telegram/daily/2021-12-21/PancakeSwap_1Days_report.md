    @rpoole69 --- *wtf, why is my dpt to receive decreasing for both basic and Unlimited! did the Basic 8.14332247557003 and now shows DPT of 132.3747792, Unlimited 38.892533245656495 cake  and shows 38.13684 DPT! WTH!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2210707)

    @Marselinho --- *What is happening with DPT? I ifoed for a 20x at least* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2212786)

    @erbseyer --- *Hahaha, i bought cake at $13+ to join IFO. Now its $12.10. I also spent more than $5 in swapping, staking and unstaking fees. Now my claimed DPT can only be sold for $2.72 less swap fees of more than $1. Then there's a problem with emission. I hope mgt team will squeeze their smart brains or this business is doomed.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2212132)

    @moranmerber1982 --- *why is the amount of dpt change every second?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2210765)

I'm wondering why there is such a big difference in the prices for the older IFOs.
