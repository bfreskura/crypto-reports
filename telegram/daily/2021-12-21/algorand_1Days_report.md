    @Tiny_Philosopher_784 --- *Me? No, not paid.   It's just the cycle. Crypto is starting to move into nyse cyclicals.   I'm sure nobody sees it, because zoom out doesnt compute. Only if you claim to be stupid, because only dumb ones think there is no historical data to look at. History never repeats itself. Humans arent creatures of habit... they never repeat the same actions ever. When you think people wont do the same things, they never do.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/324110)

    @Alma --- *This round of diving many copycat coins can no longer fluctuate.

    @Alma --- *Thank you for your approval. Now it is time to change the trading strategy. Instead of blindly following the trend of investment, it is better to stop losses in time, recover losses, trade in both directions, hedge risks, and maximize profits* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/323882)
