The weird thing is that if i  want to do a transaction on bsc network with the same trezor and adress, the transactions does go through? Any idea whats going on here? Cant send any avax or use dmart contracts now. After i fill in my trezor code it just vanishes and give transaction error fail.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/315935)
