4. **leverage, futures, time bomb**

    @rend_yyal --- *I lost $30k in September and that was when I stopped messing around with leverage. 2x leverage on a relatively safe coin is usually fine but that's not what most leveraged traders (including me) do.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/15649)

    @whale_blueq --- *And nobody understands leverage since it's mostly based on luck* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/15652)

    @cryp_opt --- *Leverage feels like trying a cassino, inside a cassino* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/15664)

    @Jared --- *Sorry for your loss, but it is not suprising if you use leverage.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/15663)

    @whale_blueq --- *Very true. It's about using the power of leverage responsibly. You can make a lot really fast and vice versa. For most people, I would never recommend it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/15647)

    @dax_on --- *The problem isn't leverage or daytrading. It's that people can't quantify risk properly. Howsmy of you know the threshold for your margin calls? Your position weight and the swing it would take to put you under, let alone the likelihood it will happen.   People don't appreciate the risk in investing especially leverage.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/15646)

    @Bitsy_boobear --- *The Bull force will be crazy* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/15757)

    @dono_dono_dono --- *Some say Bulls are giving up already ❌❌❌* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/15754)

    @c_k_c_k --- *Depends on which animal you get the meat from. Young calves can taste fuck all really, which I guess goes for beef as well. Old bulls can be near inedible if you are not into "gamy" meat, especially when shot during breeding season. All moose meat is extremely lean so those are the kind of cuts it would be most comparable to.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/15697)

    @archie_kins_00 --- *I don't know bears and bulls   I DCA like I did in May and October anyway* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/15667)
