2. **vaccinated, covid cases, vaccination**

    @BillyRoc --- *Low in the vaccinated. It's mutating in the unvaccinated and will continue to mutate. The majority of those hospitalized are unvaccinated.   Surviving doesn't always mean a quality life. I know someone who just got the sniffles, but it killed her unvaccinated coworker, and she is having memory/neurological problems.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2032976)
