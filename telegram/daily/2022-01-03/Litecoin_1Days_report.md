10. **currency, bank, send**

    @kuntpuncher --- *Sooooo……this is the pitch for crypto currency. Let’s say I want to buy some bread. Instead of just swiping my bank card, I go make an account on coin base, link my bank account, send real money to coin base, buy a currency coin like litecoin, learn how to use wallets, send litecoin to wallet, then find a shop that sells bread and accepts litecoin, open my phone, and then send litecoin payment. Did I get the gist of using crypto currency?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039288)

    @ArchSter --- *I will say this is not a true reflection on the true story of crypto... Otherwise I would not have invested in it. Would have bought tulips instead...😭😭😭* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039210)

    @ken_xmas --- *I’m the best person even there in world you study and discuss cryptocurrency with him  You can get to know more crypto currency’s peaple and comumicat with uoy do not doubt* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2038616)

    @JohnTheApostle --- *Soooo ...... This is the pitch for fiat currency. Let's say you want to send money to your friend living in a developing country. Instead of just scanning his wallet's qr code, I go open a bank account, he go open a bank account, I link his personal details as a registered payee and wait for bank approval (they may ask for further clarifications and it may take a few days), then I have to swap into his own fiat currency with high fees, send the money to him, then wait that the money arrives with an international swift transfer which can take many days, and all of that if the sending bank or receiving bank doesn't block the transaction for any reason to do a background check, ask for documentation/verifications or even flag the transaction to some authorities  Did I get the gist of using fiat currency?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039297)
