    @PmRiviere --- *to be fair after a quick check it looked legit + no token. @Cryptocamel you can probably repost if there s something constructive to say about this* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312138)

    @vasilysumanov --- *Maybe people need to prove it first with models?  If you want to say that tokenomics is cool please share model & calculations* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312322)

    @vesamm --- *only downside is cant get profit out before 12hr or 1.5% price movement of the asset. otherside pool would be drained by bots (they tried with no limits before in earlier project)  ☝️also Avalanche launch in 3 days* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312264)

2. **cosmos, polkadot, substrate**

    @Swader --- *No, Cosmos is very much a chain, a hub bridging other chains.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312104)

    @Swader --- *Substrate is the framework on which Polkadot and Kusama are built, yes.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312099)

    @tatai_007 --- *So substrate is to polkadot, what tendermint is to cosmos.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312107)

    @Swader --- *Cosmos is built on its own SDK/tech, just like Polkadot is on Substrate* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312105)

    @tatai_007 --- *So this is where I get confused about Cosmos all the time, I thought Cosmos was just an SDK that you can use to create blockchains. It doesn't have a chain itself.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312103)

    @tatai_007 --- *Also, I don't know why this never comes on Google when I searched for Cosmos vs polkadot comparison. Explains most of my doubts pretty well.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312110)

3. **audit, certik, audits**

    @Oxc4t --- *Is multiple audits from Certik worse or better than one audit from them? Can't decide.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312268)

    @ivangbi --- *(everyone else is fine, it’s just that they really don’t audit anything - currently)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312301)

    @ivangbi --- *Ctrl+f on audit discussions here please [others can’t answer cause this was talked over many times].  And aave is audited by certik as just “one of” they don’t rely on those at all.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312318)

    @awnyrvan --- *That’s very interesting. A shit ton of projects including aave et al are audited by certik.  All I meant is all the versions of contracts are audited, and yes as of now they used certik to audit.  Whom do you recommend for auditing? Trail of bits?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312316)

    @ivangbi --- *@awnyrvan ser please tone down the shilling, it’s a bit too much now. There is valid cticism that certik is shit ass fuckery moronic auditing team, and if you make an audit with it even 10 times - it doesn’t change that fact. If that’s your reasoning to say that is good security approach - you are digging one for yourself. Otherwise, all fine* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312300)

    @awnyrvan --- *Haha. Jokes aside, multiple audits come because this project follows a strict practice of full audit every time they release an upgraded contract. Scores have been very high - I think among top 5 or top 10 audit scores on certik website* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312297)
