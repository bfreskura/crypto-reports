6. **hours, processed, 72 hours**

    @KBerger --- *Thats not true. Every of my withdrawels needed more than 24 hours. Maybe they are to big to do it automatic. But it sucks anyway. Should be good if i can decide to set up my security Level lower to have faster payout* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159196)

    @weng --- *Mine is btc withdrawal NOT dBTC, pls adhere to your 72 hours withdrawal policy* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159328)

    @Alex --- *@DmgBautista - Above, Michael said BTC withdraws *are* working normally. Can someone confirm which is accurate?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159097)

    @MaveJ --- *What a mess. But dBtC are safe and still correlated to Btc? I have paid for them and in btc terms.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159077)

    @Speedy089 --- *I did a LTC withdrawal 2,5 days ago but wasn’t processed yet :( I‘m patiently waiting because I know there is this big dbtc problem which devs try to solve. But anyways not the best feeling not knowing what happened to the withdrawal. But Cake and defi chain will solve everything as best as they can so we can hopefully get back the normal within the next days.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159525)

    @Dcshel --- *Sit tight and it'll recover soon as this issue is resolved. It's ultimately worth what the market price is for BTC. Just don't sell your dBTC at moment on if even possible, because you'd lock in your loss* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159093)

    @MaveJ --- *Holy shit. dBTC is heavily dumping in DEX. All my dBTC are losing severe value* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159081)
