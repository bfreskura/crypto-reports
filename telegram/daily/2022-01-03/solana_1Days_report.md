    @PapaPinkPanda --- *there's a number of DeFi options. I personally leverage stake SOL-USDC on Tulip and Francium but I also took that position at like $150.   Lower risk, you can stake sol to stSol (get like 6%) and then stake that stSol to Francium for another 7% on top of that. stSol I think takes like 3 days to get unstaked.  I'm experimenting with sol covered calls, pretty high return (30-40% APY) but looks like that's still pretty immature* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/887606)
