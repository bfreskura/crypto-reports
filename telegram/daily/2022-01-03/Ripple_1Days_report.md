3. **year, case, april**

    @erik_sz91 --- *It would be nice to know which is the theorical maximum lenght the lawsuit could have. I mean, most of us think it will be solved this year, cause this year ISO20022 launches, and it would be strange if it starts with Ripple still in lawsuit. However can this case take like 10 years? Or that would be imposible?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3034153)
