    @PricesSlahed --- *I'm new to this group, but the same as any crypto telegram group, admin never DM, and would never steel your funds* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620054)

    @Peaky_23_Blinders --- *Hey everyone, I'm new to fantom, what are the biggest launchpads on ftm? thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620549)

    @Victor --- *I'm not seeing anywhere on the fantom foundation website to get a hold of them other than here and discord or twitter, reddit.  just the social icons.  looking for an email address* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620678)

    @pajamasfreak --- *Scroll up a bit you find one* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620265)

    @thena_beger --- *Fantom unique addresses grew over 29,000% in just a year* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619864)

    @getat7 --- *Moreover, I believe Fantom can emulate some of its features. WaykiChain runs a charity campaign which I think is making the ecosystem have more adoption everyday. Fantom can also adopt this idea.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619986)

    @MizoHosry --- *There is a new project will be launched on Fantom chain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/621084)

3. **metamask, withdraw, send ftm**

    @Alberto --- *My FTM on metamask are shown as BNB ... and all transactions fails* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619918)

    @LordTorcia --- *After I send Ftm to Binance how can I withdraw on Fantom since the tokens are on Bep2? Thank you* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619882)

    @ColinClark --- *Yes mainnet withdrawals when their not shut ? Hardly great. Your missing the point. Surely FTM should be standalone and have the direct facility so we don’t need to wait when it suits exchanges, spend additional monies to bridge, exchange, wrap etc etc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620230)

    @LordTorcia --- *Hi, I have Fantom on Bep2, how can I transfer my Ftm to the Fantom MainNet? In the official wallet the option to receive from Erc20 or Bep2 is disabled. Thank you* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619850)

    @Niels --- *Just set up my first Fantom Wallet! I want to transfer FTM from Kucoin to this wallet. i can only select I’m receiving from ‘Fantom Opera’* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/621024)

    @ColinClark --- *What I struggle to understand is why is it so awkward to work with Ftm  1) Fantom wallet stopped accepting erc20 facility  2) I have to wrap Fantom which isn’t easy 3) can’t buy Fantom direct on opera chain  4) have to use Metamask to use multichain.xyz and Metamask is awful and expensive  5) exchanges block withdrawals  Come on guys there must be an easy way. If I have to buy FTM in an ERC 20 please please please make it easy to swap to opera and simply to wrap* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620225)

4. **days, lock, period**

    @Mcjig --- *of course there are no rewards for 7 days. because your no longer staking* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620554)

    @Quantanamoto👻 --- *You will get a penalty if you unstake before the end of the locking period.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620520)

    @Mcjig --- *if you lock for 14 days and the timer is finished. you would be on no lock at 4% interest. still have a 7 day wait if you undelegate* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620550)

    @Mcjig --- *some chains have 30 day unbonding times* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620556)

    @Nida --- *Like say I plan to stake for 30 days, should I still choose 365 days, just to get highest APR* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620513)

    @Nida --- *For staking locking period, does everyone choose the max (like 200+ days) to get the high apr, and then you can unstake at any time , only 7 days ???* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620512)

5. **stake, stake ftm, finance**

    @Luke --- *I found staking via spookyswap to be easiest, you’ll need to stake as a pair (ftm-boo for example) though. Same with Tomb finance.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/619939)

    @pajamasfreak --- *Officially you can stake on fwallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620959)

    @Paper_Prophet --- *Need to bridge some ETH from fantom to etherium. What’s the best cheapest way please?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/620475)
