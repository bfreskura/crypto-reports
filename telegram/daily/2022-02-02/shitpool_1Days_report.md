    @MoneroPal --- *He ran an unlicensed investment fund that produced fake front-projects to lure in investors and hid knowledge of convicted frauds managing it to raise money from investors, while using a sophisticated scheme to sell out of it. The attack vector here is Americans were harmed. He’ll eventually go down, they have it out for him already due to MIM and mentioned it at a senate hearing in the US.

    @MoneroPal --- *It is highly unlikely ETH will be dethroned anytime soon it just hasn’t happaned. Nothing of importance has been built on AVAX, FTM, Polygon, SOL, or any of the new L1’s.

    @arbullz --- *coinbase reputable.. lol gimme a break* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/722074)

    @MoneroPal --- *I see some Turks, but they’re mostly German turks with TradeFi experience. Not sure I see a connection with seedy Turkish money launderers or other scammers here* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/722220)

    @MoneroPal --- *Offshore funds are scams, no hedge fund domiciles anywhere but AU, CA, US, NL, UK, SG, or HK. There are a few in the Nordics and China. The feeder funds are almost always Cayman Island or Bahamas based. The main management company is always in the other aforementioned jurisdictions though.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/722215)

    @MoneroPal --- *Their website looks awful. The team looks like stock photos from a nightclub. Their appears to be ZERO mention of any sort of hedge fund, it’s thesis, prospectus, performance, or any links to how it is managed, custody, prime brokerage, etc. It is 1000% a scam.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/722210)

    @MoneroPal --- *You must be confusing them with someone else ser. It’s a fairly small team of Swiss that are mostly former TradeFi. They offer a product for merchants to accpet crypto, prime brokerage, custody, lending, and opeate an exchange. They have a 250M CHF insurnace policy on custody. Explain how a rug would be possible. This isn’t some DeFi startup.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/722099)
