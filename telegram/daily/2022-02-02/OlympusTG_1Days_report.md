1. **apy, 1000, 1000 apy**

    @nfwaple --- *no I am pretty sure it will stay 500% minimum within the token supply range at the moment, if they want to decrease the APY before we hit the upper token supply range, there would probably be a proposal* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177903)

    @timon_k --- *how much is the apy going to go down in the next few months?  I don’t think the price would go down much more, but the APY keeps declining, can’t calculate against that if I don’t know* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/178103)

    @TNrafi2109 --- *So if we keep on formula, apy can keep decreasing* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177901)

2. **reward, rate, reward rate**

    @TNrafi2109 --- *I have been investing since last year when apy is above 4k%. I cannot put additional investmemt if the apy and price keep decreasing. That why i nees to understand the calculation of reward rate* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/176409)

    @TNrafi2109 --- *If i know how apy is derived, i wont have more question why apy is always decreasing. Because it is depend on reward rate, supply and staked. Thats why i need to understand the apy calculation* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/176397)

    @SaintJerome --- *OHM is good for now. I'm talking about when OHM supply is close to 100mill. 100mill is a psychological barrier where new investors may deem OHM as being too diluted* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/176073)
