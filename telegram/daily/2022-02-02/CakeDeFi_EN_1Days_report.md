    @Kassius84 --- *Hey, you can use an exchange, which has DFI listed or you're using the DeFiChain DEX https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/defichain/markets/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170368)

    @Generalmuhatsi --- *I use Coin base it not the case. I use Onus its not the case. I use Byit its not the case. It was my suggestion and have got my level. You need 10000$ 20000$ people* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170638)

    @Generalmuhatsi --- *I have a suggestion To Cake management. This withdraw fee of Approximately $20 is tooo much. Imagine you invested $100 and at end of month you profits are $23 😂 😂 Now if am withdrawing $123 am getting $103... 😂 Meaning whole month I was working for Cake. You should look into this. Maybe you should say form this amount to this withdraw fee is $5 and other limits $10, but I think for now this buisness is useless. Can invest all month and get $3 on $100* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170627)

    @Razali --- *CakeDefi's investors are generally very long term.. I myself froze all of my DFI for 10 years and have set the freezer to auto-renew.. $100 will go a long way in 10 years.. so I wouldn't worry about withdrawal fees as they are right now, which is normal in my opinion..   Besides, as mentioned earlier, there are cheaper alternatives to make withdrawals..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170655)

    @DmgBautista --- *Hi! Transactions need a minimum of 30 confirmations before being processed at Cake, so a minimum 15 minutes. I would go and say that between processing and depositing, you could consider about half an hour* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170891)

    @erikaa1997 --- *Tell me about the $50 referral bonus* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/171032)

    @omeryldrm3469 --- *I have 37 references and my balance is increasing every week. I don't know if my registration bonus is a referral bonus, how can I understand it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/171068)

    @fabioandreatta --- *Check your referral page, if you have valid Referrals, you only get rewards if your referrals have enough assets (more than $50 USD) - All referral rewards were paid out yesterday, meaning there is/was no issue* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170548)

7. **rewards, 10 years, years**

    @Spikeboibeigel --- *Hmm, in that case I am confused. I have been testing it around a week. But the rewards are not near that on avg 90-91%. More like close to 60%. (I have frozen for 120 months)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170500)

    @zachgax --- *I freeze Staked DFI for 10 years to get the 2X rewards, but I don’t think LM freezing has such additional bonus.   So I normally freeze LM for 12 months, as it seemed to me to be the best balance of fee reduction, additional % rewards and duration.   LM is something I might want to remove and reinvest in other pool. 10 years is too long a time.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170501)

    @zachgax --- *Apy is based on best case scenario of compounding interest over a year.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170488)

    @Spikeboibeigel --- *So the average is that 91.49%? In the above snip* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170495)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *Correct, that is the 7 day average* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170496)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *Cake already shows the average  But keep in mind that Rewards are dropping 1,65% every 11 days* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170494)
