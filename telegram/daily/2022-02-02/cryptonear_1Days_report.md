    @chasefreo --- *OP Games is furthering its goal of bringing more gamers and game developers to Web 3 by teaming up with YGG. They're one of our official partners of OP Games’ Web 3 accelerator program hosted by our game publishing arm, GM Frens, launched at the start of the year. The said accelerator aims to train game developers in building blockchain games to produce a playable demo and receive funding from GM Frens or its network of investors. With this, YGG may also exercise their option to invest in some of the projects that will come out of the program. Developers who wish to publish their games with GM Frens can apply to do so on their website. Applications for the pilot accelerator program will be accepted from January 6 until February 4, 2022. https://www.gmfrens.games/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/325174)
