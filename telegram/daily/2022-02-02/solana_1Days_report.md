    @mahib45 --- *Hello!  Mainnet is launched! It was launched in March 2020 and is successfully working and updating, (done billion transactions already) as well as getting new functions. For your understanding - Yes, we were first calling it beta because it was just launched and not every function was available.   We will keep the suffix "beta" for a year or so because we want to check the mainnet stability in long term and make sure we have a great product. But it's a working network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/927728)

9. **nft, projects, nfts**

    @kraytos1 --- *Any tips of getting into solana nfts?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/927231)

    @Kareemelazab --- *First of all you have to understand what an nft is, then find projects you like and that you think will blow up when released(consult their twitter and discord server, the more people  the better ) then create a wallet with solana tokens ( maybe phantom or even coinbase wallet )  and invest in the project (or more projects) you find interesting.  This is not a giude, for that I highly suggest passing 3/4 hours on youtube and hearing the youtubers opinion on the theme.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/927244)

    @g_v_d_s --- *I’m curious, I think it will do great things for solana based nfts* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/928661)
