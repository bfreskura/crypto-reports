    @Shinnanigans --- *Not a metamask user myself but I've set it up before a few times, I'd personally recommend just importing everything to trustwallet or safepal, they are both mobile wallets but neither have failed me and are very reliable with the dapp browser I've always found (especially safepal you can even change rpc, trustwallet is great just if congestion hits no rpc changing). Other than that, for support about meta, your probably better off directly contacting metamask themselves if they have an email just shoot one over to them and ask what your issue is, friendly customer support from what I've heard 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2316372)
