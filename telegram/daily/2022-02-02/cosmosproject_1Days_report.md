3. **inflation, supply, token**

    @Altaf1111 --- *Price will dump in future to less than 1$ if more coin daily comes in circulation* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484151)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Atom is inflationary token. Inflation ratio is around %9 now.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484144)

    @schooloffish --- *Any recommendations for swapping ETH to ATOM? lowest cost.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484390)

    @Andi_EWM --- *Well I am not an expert, but why is ATOM a token and not a coin! For me this sounds always not as good as having a coin! ETH is a coin and tokens are built on it... Why is this different at cosmos?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484550)

    @encrypted14 --- *What's better APR wise? Staking with keplr, or providing liquidity on Osmosis, given the IL risk?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484673)

    @Crypto-Jesus --- *keplr for single staking and osmosis dex is good for LPing* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484389)

    @AtomJazz --- *Make sure you avoid exchange validators! Other than that...The best validator is always subjective, here are some factors that might help:   - Commission Rate:  This is the % of earned rewards that go to the validator. Not the % of your total stake, just to eliminate that confusion.   - Self-Bonded rate:  This is the % of bonded ATOM that belong to the validator. Think of this as their skin in the game.   - Decentralization:  Choosing the smaller validators helps to decentralize the network which improves security overall. Again, decentralization should be a priority. On this point, centralized exchanges are not the best choice as they don't really support the network at all.   You can learn more about each validator in their profiles on the wallets and explorers.  The 8-10% is almost for everyone, feel free to use this reward calculator  https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/cosmos  Commissions can be changed anytime so keep an eye on your validator via telegram or twitter* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484617)

5. **airdrops, airdrop, nodes**

    @sav72 --- *Hello  i Just bought Atom and staked on Exodus wallet. Can i receive any airdrop or i have ti change wallet?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484409)

    @Jonathan --- *Typically how much $ needed to stake to get a decent airdrop?  20k or more?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484233)

    @dd1one1 --- *hi admin ,   i have my atom on a ledger nano,,   ive been delegating them for the last year.,   when i just tried to undelegate them ,, it says unable to due to restricted access to this account.,,   has anyone had this issue,,,  the delegator is “castle,node” ,????  any help please 🙏????* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483987)

    @Matt_Blocks_United --- *To make sure you qualify for airdrops: 1. Avoid centralized exchange nodes, like Kraken or Binance 2. Avoid 0% commission nodes 3. Avoid the top 10 and even top 25 largest nodes  We have a tutorial that should answer most, if not all of your questions. You can check it out here:  https://blocksunited.com/how-to-choose-a-validator/  You're certainly welcome to stake with us at Blocks United.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484735)

    @Matt_Blocks_United --- *Atomic wallet severely limits your access to the Cosmos ecosystem and you'll need to use Keplr to claim your airdrops (assuming you qualify). The good news is that you can import your Atomic seed phrase or private key into Keplr and then use both wallets. We have a tutorial that shows how to import seed phrases from Exodus, Atomic and Trust wallet. You can check it out here:  https://blocksunited.com/import-exodus-wallet-into-keplr/  Let me know how else I can help.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484730)
