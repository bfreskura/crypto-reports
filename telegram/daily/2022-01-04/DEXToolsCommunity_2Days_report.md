## 🔝 **Top keywords and related messages**

1. **dextools, dext, new**

    @JoeyDieleman --- *Yeah thats sad, the whole purpose of DexTools if to give you info to not fall for scams, only buys, low score no public contract should give people red flags, of course even then dextools can never be 100% accurate, there will always be a fight between detecting scams and scammers comming up with new things. Please use dextools as intended and always do extra research on top of that. See the socials and check those too (and don'y fall for bots saying all the time the project is awesome and 100x is the only way). But for the tokens you gave, Dextools is pretty clear.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321274)

    @stanes --- *Yes you can set price alerts. Standard users can even get alerts on TG and email. Indeed devs are working on a native mobile app.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321150)

    @jmorfeo --- *on the same project dextscore is different if I see a pair or another ...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321782)

    @stanes --- *Free users can only set alerts for ETH pairs.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321152)

    @RhoToken --- *Hello, dextools search and pair explorer is not loading for me, everything else is working and showing. Any chance anyone knows how to solve this. It's been 2 days.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321488)

2. **chart, data, candles**

    @napascual --- *Nothing to fix there. A candle normalization has already been done, those candles just cannot be avoided. That's just blockchain data. You can still stretch the candles to display the chart dates you're interested in.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320928)

    @wealthyhobo --- *If you zoom out of the chart you will see a massive red candle way before that current chart. The first green candle you see is the actual day the project was launched* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320931)

    @Reza --- *Please look at the full chart... There is a big red candle that occurred prior to launching. It's inaccurate and misleading. Please take appropriate action, as this can be detrimental.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321044)

    @Fejkolini --- *There you have it. Distortion of data were pre launch* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321049)

    @gumbercules --- *usually if someone adds small amounts of liquidity before the team it can create some wild candles* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321054)

    @Dom1234 --- *i mean if you fix the chart to when we officially launched, this will be resolved* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321071)
