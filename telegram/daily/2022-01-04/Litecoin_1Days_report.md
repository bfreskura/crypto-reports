    @Musashi_Kansai --- *The problem is we are seeing very specific and repeated FUD talking points that are obvious manipulation. Someone who complains or gets frustrated once in a while isn't the problem. Repeatedly FUDing is a bannable offense.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039924)

    @RorschachTesst --- *How convenient that you treat  2013-2017 and 2018-2021 as two separate eras. Ltc just retraced its 2017 price in 2021. It did not shatter records* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039020)

    @TrojanHorshe --- *Even Charlie prediction was wrong on making new ATH in December 2021 . I think LTC is pretty much frocked* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039405)

    @bogdan15xor --- *hi gents. new to Litecoin. how does the Litecoin protocol react to miner reward halvings every 4 years? does the difficulty to mine change too to prevent miners from leaving? how does it work?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039106)

    @bogdan15xor --- *what incentivizes miners to stay on the network as the number of rewards per block decrease?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039137)

4. **update, mimblewimble, mweb**

    @moonsie --- *MimbleWimble won't make a difference anymore; people have known it's coming for years and price is still 70% down.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2040013)

    @silverjxy --- *I remember being in litcoin at start of 2021 and hearing them talk about releasing mimble wimble* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039644)

    @silverjxy --- *How will mimblewimble effect ltc price when  they have their own native token?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039637)

5. **currency, buy, afraid**

    @moonsie --- *this is how fast things can change. within 1 year a well-established ancient coin can go from relevant to irrelevant and stomped into the dirt shitcoin* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039372)

    @kuntpuncher --- *Sooooo……this is the pitch for crypto currency. Let’s say I want to buy some bread. Instead of just swiping my bank card, I go make an account on coin base, link my bank account, send real money to coin base, buy a currency coin like litecoin, learn how to use wallets, send litecoin to wallet, then find a shop that sells bread and accepts litecoin, open my phone, and then send litecoin payment. Did I get the gist of using crypto currency?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039288)

    @Jim --- *People are afraid of lockdowns and all the situation... thats why they dont invest now. If i remember right inflation in usa this year is 6.3 or 6.7%* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039179)

    @standard211 --- *Yes bro I want you to tell me more about cryptocurrency* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039194)

6. **privacy, optional, monero**

    @bogdan15xor --- *how would optional privacy work? I assume sending from a personal wallet to a personal wallet can be private, but as soon as you interact with an exchange the privacy goes away, no?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039721)

    @RabbitL0v3r --- *Monero is build from scratch with privacy in mind Mweb add optional privacy to litecoin They don't serve the same purpose* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039960)

    @RabbitL0v3r --- *Optional privacy =/= optional transparency And monero is still on the biggest exchange and got atomic swap with btc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039717)

    @RabbitL0v3r --- *@kevinpita was asking about privacy feature in the litecoin network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039805)

    @pls369 --- *I really respect developers who care about privacy and freedom. They are and will always be at the forefront of human rights and freedom. Unfortunately there are really only a handful.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039648)

    @bogdan15xor --- *I know Monero and Litecoin MW do not have the same privacy, but could Litecoin achieve the same level of privacy by adding multiple steps?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039943)

7. **pump, ltc, ltc pump**

    @pls369 --- *Man i can clearly see the whales really want to suppress the ltc price. This means pump will come soon. Just be patient people* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039612)

    @kevinpita --- *Will I need an specific wallet to use it? if yes would it be ltc core?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039795)

    @ArchSter --- *Chrimbo and new year over so expect numbers to go down until schools and people go back to work make numbers go up again.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2039147)
