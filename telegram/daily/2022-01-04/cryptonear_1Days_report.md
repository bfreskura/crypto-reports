    @NEARverse_xd --- *No i dont think so. Just send Near from cex to your near wallet and then connect your wallet with rainbow bridge and bridge from near to aurora. Thats it.   Is not it far better then paying high ETH gas fee without any reason? Why you want to pay high fees ;_;* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/260279)

4. **inflation, supply, 25**

    @covidfraud --- *5% inflation compared to what? coz if taking about NEAR value compared to US$, that's at at least 20% inflation (prob a lot more). So if NEAR value was reducing by 5%/year in US$, that means inflation is actually at least 25%* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259943)

    @kv9990 --- *60% of that is in circulation so even after maths , that would be 8% inflation on circulating supply 🥲 how 20/25%* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259951)

    @larry_lang --- *5% compared to the initial total supply* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259947)

    @Infinitebacking --- *Can I ask why only 60% of Near's suppy is in circulation?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259249)

    @larry_lang --- *1 year later the total supply would be 1B* 105%= 1B and another 50M of NEAR* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259949)

    @kv9990 --- *That doesn't makes any sense ..? How 5%=25% ;_;* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259946)

5. **coinlist, locker, 35**

    @StephenShimel --- *We have officially locked our dev wallet tokens with #PolarisLock   The lock can be seen at https://polaristoken.io/Locker/0x631edd14bb0b2505c91176fEeDC5f082D27Dd5B8/0xac6d8E9Cc30131F574EDfd161c8B6Ac648B4b20D* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259884)

    @larry_lang --- *hmm is there a way for investors to see through the details of that locker?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259891)

    @larry_lang --- *hmm so the idea was to create a locker that dev team can look thier contract in it- am i getting it right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259887)

    @Kripto_Raptor --- *and this lp locker thing makes sure developers dont misbehave right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259879)

    @ahvousdiraijemaman --- *hey guys anyone heard of Aragon here before? just wondering how do they differ compared to NEAR* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/260523)

    @ahvousdiraijemaman --- *which is better? is there a way to compare?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/260530)

    @daplek --- *near is a protocol with a proof of stake consensus, while aragon is a yield farming that runs on defi. i see* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/260525)

    @larry_lang --- *hmm i think that there is indeed better farm, but better farm with better APR mean higher risk as well* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259350)

    @ahvousdiraijemaman --- *but both aragon and near have similar utilities in the sense that they provide a plug to play experience for people to build a chain right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/260526)
