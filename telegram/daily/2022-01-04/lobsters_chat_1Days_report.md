2. **audit, certik, audited**

    @Oxc4t --- *Is multiple audits from Certik worse or better than one audit from them? Can't decide.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312268)

    @ivangbi --- *Ctrl+f on audit discussions here please [others can’t answer cause this was talked over many times].  And aave is audited by certik as just “one of” they don’t rely on those at all.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312318)

    @ivangbi --- *@awnyrvan ser please tone down the shilling, it’s a bit too much now. There is valid cticism that certik is shit ass fuckery moronic auditing team, and if you make an audit with it even 10 times - it doesn’t change that fact. If that’s your reasoning to say that is good security approach - you are digging one for yourself. Otherwise, all fine* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312300)

    @awnyrvan --- *Haha. Jokes aside, multiple audits come because this project follows a strict practice of full audit every time they release an upgraded contract. Scores have been very high - I think among top 5 or top 10 audit scores on certik website* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312297)

    @FaevDaniel --- *The fact that the audit(s) are from Certik is bad enough* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312269)
