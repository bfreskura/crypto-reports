    @MoneroPal --- *LOL, there is no money in his platform, TIME is getting rekt, they’re not money managers, but clowns, nobody should entrust those slobs with managing $850M and distributing it out as if they were a asset management firm. They’re clueless, currently it’s essentially a ponzi, except for the fact they don’t actually pay out with investors funds, just with inflation.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/713901)

    @MoneroPal --- *The amount of investment and development trumps any temporary issues. Far more so then Twitter and Discord clowns that are investing $150 in Avax. Total apples to flank stank comparison.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/713887)

    @DappGod --- *Konma is a venture that is being built on Blockchain for many different use cases. We have bootstrapped all projects under Konma for 3 years now and it is time to raise funds which we are doing on Project Catalyst Fund 7 by Cardano. We have submitted 7 different proposals under Konma and the funding comes to projects that have the most votes. We have come past all the stages and now we are at the final voting stage and that is where we need your support.   What we are looking for now is your support for voting our project.  *Kindly take a few minutes to read our proposals* https://linktr.ee/KonmaCatalystFund7  *Here is a link to get more details on Konma*  https://linktr.ee/konma  *Get information on how to vote in the link below* -  https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005679386  *Still need more information?*  We catch up *everyday* at *7:00 PM IST* for a virtual meet called *Konma United*. Come join us, meet new people and know all about Konma and updates https://konmahood.konma.community/posts/19438959?utm_source=manual  Your support would make a huge difference. You can also forward this to your friends and family who might be active in the crypto or blockchain space.

    @MoneroPal --- *Not at all, but greatly dislike Dani and his ecosystem, believe he is a total clown. Loves to spread hopium, but is clealy clueless, his projects are dog shit too. MIM has no utility but looping in his fun house of projects. TIME is hyper inflationary worthless shit with no plan for the future just infighting and frog memes.
