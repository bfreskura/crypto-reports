    @Lidavv --- *Ya i  like it. But i not quite sure your standards setting here* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359734)

    @Lidavv --- *That is whole truth and nothing but the truth* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359728)

    @Lidavv --- *@Theroryshow @chrisbarrett please review what i have say* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359664)

4. **discussion, channel, official**

    @Wizard --- *Okay thank you. But why does a massive project like LINK don’t have an official price channel? Not difficult to have one, and all you need is a couple of admins to keep everything under control.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359043)

    @Linkederic --- *The majority of serious projects prohibit price discussion in their official channels in my experience.   The official channels are intended to be high signal:noise ratio to serve curious people across all spectrums from third party developers leveraging Chainlink to enthusiasts looking to simply keep up to date on the project. Allowing price speculation is a surefire recipe for the exact opposite of that.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359052)

    @Lidavv --- *There is a discussion with 200k view* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359705)

    @Shogun187 --- *I saw the video you're referring to and again, it's solely based on a price concern which is out of the scope of this channel.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359710)

    @Wizard --- *I understand that and I agree. But I’m not talking about this main channel. I’m asking why there isn’t a separate price channel, which is made by the official team where people can talk price. There are only unofficial channels where people could get easily scammed. If we have an official separate price channel with a couple of admins, that would help a lot.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359100)

    @Chad --- *Cause the founder doesn’t care about price* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359045)

5. **tvl, solana, saber**

    @MarcTillement --- *Hey guys Question coming to mind seeing this thread https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1476961379231965196/photo/1 How does CL even claim Saber TVL while not being on Solana mainnet?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359072)

    @nam_nguyenson --- *|| Saber helps facilitate the transfer of assets between Solana and other blockchains.  Maybe there’s something there since Saber is not limited to only Solana. And since Chainlink is blockchain-agnostic, they might be using price feeds through other means. I’ll leave it to the experts with more technical understanding of this, such as those on our Discord so don’t take my words for it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359113)

    @marcromeron --- *I don't even know but trust me that the highest ones.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359735)

    @marcromeron --- *The TVL of Saber is 658 m . I don't think that affects to much the counting.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359109)

    @MarcTillement --- *That does not explain counting as tvl at least to my understanding* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359108)

    @marcromeron --- *But let me ask how we count the TVL secured.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359110)

6. **movements, token, indicated**

    @Linkederic --- *As William indicated the blockchain is a public record and you can draw your own conclusions from the information there.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359441)

    @Linkederic --- *As William indicated, the team never has commented on token movements and I don’t expect they ever will.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359435)

    @Shogun187 --- *The team has never commented on token transactions/movements.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359426)

    @Wizard --- *Hi guys, is it true that the team announced they won’t sell any more tokens?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359419)

    @Wizard --- *Thank you, but do you guys have any info about the team not selling anymore? Even if they didn’t say so themselves.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359438)

    @MarcTillement --- *https://github.com/orgs/saber-hq/repositories?q=&type=all&language=&sort=  And it is not that hard to double check — they are open source* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359101)

7. **post, twitter, pic**

    @Memetic_polyalloy --- *I had someone message me the other day who had the same profile pic and name as you, too. They wished me a Merry Christmas and left the chat.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359029)

    @Wizard --- *I don’t think if multiple 500K+ twitter accounts tweet something like that, that they just made it up. Maybe next time try helping out instead of being Mr. Smarty Pants* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359431)

    @PTournesol --- *Hello Éric someone send messages with thé same pic of you* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359023)

    @Shogun187 --- *Because Twitter is a public forum where anyone can post whatever they want?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359428)

    @Lidavv --- *I might send a message binance ceo* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359732)

    @BrapreetLadysMan --- *Then probably post on Twitter and telegram* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/359443)
