    @iamJubi --- *Hello. Let me check with the team as I am not sure with the right APY last night if it literally halved. But Number of users, TVL on the pool, and price of tokens involved affects the APY change.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/236640)

    @michaelder --- *good morning team.....just wondering if someone can explain to me why the apy in BSC has litterally halved overnight....its gone from about 280% to 110%......not trying to FUD at all...just would like some clarification......ive been with DYP since mid last year and it was far better returns then compared to now.......as an investor just asking the simple question what has changed........unfortuately im now locked for 90 days ........knowing there are better returns available elsewhere is a bit frustrating.........whats in the pipeline thats going to pick all this up again? dont get me wrong the team does a great job but also at the end of the day performance returns for investors is what counts as well......have a great day all 🙂 cheers!!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/236634)

    @michaelder --- *Hi Jubi, thanks for that......when I look at the pool my % share has not dropped at all......so if the number of users would of dropped i would expect my share to increase.....plus market pricing hasnt changed that much to warrant such a decrease in apy......im aware what affects apy but with such a large drop there has to be some other reason...cheers 🙂 !!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/236647)
