3. **cold wallet**

    @agentpiki --- *Go to bt.io and link your trust wallet then swap* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3764792)

    @agentpiki --- *Not. I think of it as this:  A Whale bought TRX from binance and transferred the amount to cold wallet (ledger probably), or to hot wallet, for staking / freezing.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3767931)

    @EVA659EVA --- *Any other opinion? Care to share?  My opinion is that whales are withdrawing their fund from binance as they wont be trading anytime soon. Its always safer to store your fund in a cold wallet than storing in an exchange.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3767955)
