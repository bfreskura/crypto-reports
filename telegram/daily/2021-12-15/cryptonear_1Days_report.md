"Dear user, NEAR network is experiencing congestion due to a large spike in withdrawal volume. This has resulted in longer withdrawal processing time. The withdrawal function has been suspended and will resume at the earliest once the congestion has reduced. In the interim, you can click ""Set Reminder"" on the crypto withdrawal page to receive an email/SMS notification once the withdrawal function is restored. As of now, we do not have an ETA for this case."* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/239569)
