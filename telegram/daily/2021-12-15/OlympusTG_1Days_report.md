4. **wrap**

    @Poopoo --- *Olympus Migration TL;DR for the Ohmies  - Current sOHM won't see rebases anymore. will get all backdated rewards whenever you migrate. - Folks collateralised at Rari don't need to do anything. will be taken care of in the backend. - sOHM to sOHM v2 migration will become available soon. - sOHM to gOHM and wsOHM to gOHM migration is already available at https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/wrap - In no scenario will you lose rewards  The APY will show correctly on website when V2 migration is done. Current sOHM won't see rebases anymore. Ohmies will get all backdated rewards whenever you migrate.  Ohmies collateralized at Rari don't need to do anything. Everything will be taken care of in the backend.  You don’t have to unstake or do anything right now. sOHM to sOHM v2 migration will become available soon with easy step by step instructions.   sOHM: wait for migration to sOHM v2 or wrap to gOHM wsOHM:  convert to gOHM gOHM:  nothing fsOHM (Rari): nothing* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/120083)

    @Enjoytaira --- *I don’t want wrap unwrap, i don’t want gohm, only i want my sohm v1 convert to sohm v2. How i do this pleaseeeee?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/122451)

    @Poopoo --- *read pinned message, and question about migration yes, wrap your sOHM to gOHM, stop asking about sOHM v2, it is unnecessary, just wrap to gOHM, do not answer dm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/122763)

    @Pol --- *Yes same to me. After migration, i continue having sOHM and inside wrap i see gOHM* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/122709)

    @DandC932830 --- *Nah that’s the weird part, is following migration, under wrap I can’t see any sOHM or gOHM available.   Under staking it still reads I have sOHM, same with my metamask wallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/121682)

    @hunkarperk --- *So as i understand, we will choose just wrap in the dashboard after that wrap sohm to gohm, complete the step after that it's done! Do we need to unstake first or stake again or dont need to do anythin?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/121195)

    @ibaniba --- *Hi all- there’s been a lot of chatter but I can’t seem to find what I’m looking for. My sOhm has been missing. I checked on etherscan and it shows that it was migrated and transferred to sohmv2 about 8-10 hours ago.  That said- Am now sure how to locate my sOhm as it’s not shown on my MetaMask nor the app.    Can anyone provide guidance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/120118)
