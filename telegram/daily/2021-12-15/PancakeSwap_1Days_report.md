    @Flower --- *No, it’s not auto used as far as I’m concerned but I think it should be automatically used for the IFO purchase because to unstake, commit, collect and restake whilst BSC congestion will not help anyone* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2187981)

    @GBcrypto10 --- *Yeah I was unclear on that from reading the page, but wanted to clarify. The rewards are coming in at a higher rate on the IFO pool currently, and it cant hurt to stack IFO credits, but I dont wanna commit to participating in the upcoming IFO... so hoping the CAKE I staked in IFO pool isnt auto used for this IFO* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2187963)

8. **defi protocol**

    @SecuestPcs --- *Did you keep your 12 words (seed phrase) on paper or did you keep them online? (Pc, phone photos, notes page, etc.)  - have you entered any link and entered these 12 words, for the purpose of connecting a wallet  - Do you have a virus program? you may have somehow infected your pc or phone  - Can you share the link of Pancakeswap you entered to trade? On the computer, go to the time you made a transaction from the past and take a screenshot at,,if you are entering from the phone, take ss from the phone. No one can access your wallets without those 12 secret words, no real protocol will ask you for seeds. if you haven't done the transaction, open a new wallet and transfer your assets there.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2191994)

    @Jeffs_3 --- *You need to stake that to participate in upcoming IFO’s. The part of the share you can buy on the IFO will depend on the amount and time that you are staking in this pool. The pool itself roughly has the same APR as the auto cake pool, slightly lower APR because the compound function is a little less frequent. It is basically part of the new 3.0 IFO protocol from pancake.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2189559)

    @Ceddi200 --- *Sounds like your wallets been compromised. Nothing anyone can do if that's the case.

    @bahadirkinali --- *Hello there, I have a question about slippage tolerance.   The protocol does not allow to set more than a certain amount of slippage. Like %60 or sth. What is the reason for that? Is it something related to technical or is it only thing to protect the user. thank you in advance.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2187401)
