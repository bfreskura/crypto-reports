    @p --- *Hey guys. I have some issue withdrawing and restaking ada on Yoroi. I’m using my Trezor T for my yoroi wallet and I transferred Ada into it 2 months ago, delegated it with no issue. Now I’m trying to redelegate it to a different pool and a message pops up on my Trezor, saying “change address payment credential is a path…” then when i tick the checkmark, it takes me to another prompt saying “change address staking credential is a key hash…” then to another prompt of a sum of my account minus the amount I’m trying to withdraw before taking me to the standard signing off that fails to go through. I’ve noticed the same problem on the forums in a few cases but there seems to be no definitive solution for this. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758585)

6. **thought**

    @TheBigBossK --- *Is there a video where Charles shares his thoughts on the future of Bitcoin or Ethereum?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/759058)

    @TheBigBossK --- *Like what he thinks Bitcoin will look in 10 years, stuff like that. He mentions often that Cardano is a very long-term project, would be interesting to hear his thoughts on Bitcoin* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/759085)

8. **official statement**

    @echion --- *I'm a bit confused about the official statement that you can use one wallet for multiple delegates. Do I understand this correctly: especially with the yoroi wallet it is possible to delegate to multiple pools with a single wallet, but it does not do anything because the mainnet only supports delegation of the wallet address and thus only the first delegation of several in the wallet actually generates rewards?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/759212)

    @TheBigBossK --- *I thought the same. I was like "is there an official Yoroi chat?".* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/759083)
