Sophia beingAI is the virtual, anime version of the world’s most loved and celebrated robot - Sophia. Sophia is the first robot citizen, a brand ambassador and an internet celebrity. Sophia beingAI’s story is grounded in the heritage and origin story of Sophia the Robot. Alethea and beingAI share a mission of exploring human identity and intelligence through AI, making this a natural partnership. As an iNFT, Sophia beingAI can now cross the digital landscape and offer real-time interactions so you can get to know the personality behind the asset. Together we are launching Binance’s first Intelligence IGO (Initial Game Offering) featuring one hundred intelligent NFTs.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/409177)

    @Metavurse --- *In October ‘21, Alethea concluded an incredibly successful auction of their first collection known as The Revenants. This is a collection of one hundred Intelligent NFTs, based on history’s most significant figures. From Aristotle to Cleopatra to Cinderella, the icons of the past, both real and fictional, were reborn as iNFTs. The Revenants can now be found on Noah’s Ark, where you can use them to record custom video messages, upload audio, or - in the case of some characters such as Julius Caesar or Adam Smith - you can even interact and hold a conversation with them. The highest selling Revenant during the auction was Vincent Van Gogh, who sold for 58 ETH ($232,000 USD).* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/409169)
