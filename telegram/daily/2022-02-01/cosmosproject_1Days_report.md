1. **atom, validator, airdrops**

    @Altaf1111 --- *Price will dump in future to less than 1$ if more coin daily comes in circulation* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484151)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Make sure you avoid exchange validators! Other than that...The best validator is always subjective, here are some factors that might help:   - Commission Rate:  This is the % of earned rewards that go to the validator. Not the % of your total stake, just to eliminate that confusion.   - Self-Bonded rate:  This is the % of bonded ATOM that belong to the validator. Think of this as their skin in the game.   - Decentralization:  Choosing the smaller validators helps to decentralize the network which improves security overall. Again, decentralization should be a priority. On this point, centralized exchanges are not the best choice as they don't really support the network at all.   You can learn more about each validator in their profiles on the wallets and explorers.  The 8-10% is almost for everyone, feel free to use this reward calculator  https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/cosmos  Commissions can be changed anytime so keep an eye on your validator via telegram or twitter* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484330)

    @AtomJazz --- *It's the best and most used cosmos wallet https://medium.com/chainapsis/how-to-use-keplr-wallet-40afc80907f6?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483991)

    @LATOKEN_Jogiyat --- *Hey Zoltan, does the team at Cosmos do AMA's?  I'd love to update our community on ATOM's  plans for 2022* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484281)

    @AtomJazz --- *Can't help you much. We don't recommend using Trust wallet for Cosmos assets and I have 0 idea what poocoin app is 😁* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484041)

    @Andi_EWM --- *At Kava platform! You get around 50% when you supply Atom to there lending protocol! Cool thing is you can leverage your position without risk when you borrow the same asset and supply again and so on.... Kava have their own chain on Cosmos ecosystem.... For me the best Defi platform I used so far... Only  thing that is perhaps negative for some people is that you have to lock your rewards(which you get in KAVA and HARD) for 12 or 1month. With 12 month lock you get the full Rewards with 1 Month only 1/5.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483739)

    @ls -al --- *No problem at all, will wait and see what official announcement says.  My gut feel is maybe they are waiting for shared security.  Completely guessing here.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/484129)

    @ggwashinton1 --- *no issue. Just eth maxis making shit up* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483666)

6. **luna, driver, main driver**

    @bloodonthemarket --- *Cos LUNA have a problem with 20% APY via ANCHOR__fear around that project hitting cosmos* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483628)

    @hleb_albau --- *we are all interconnected here and luna was main driver for months* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483780)

    @hleb_albau --- *till luna will fall, but when gravity will online it maybe bounces back* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483778)

    @AtomJazz --- *Agree to disagree. For sure ATOM JUNO and OSMO are correlated but not LUNA. This will probably change in the future since now we have it on IBC too but historically speaking this has not been the case* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483783)

    @AtomJazz --- *No it wasn't. Luna was a main driver for Luna not for ATOM* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483781)

    @AtomJazz --- *Wut? Luna is an application specific cosmos chain that has nothing to do with cosmos hub and ATOM specifically* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483779)
