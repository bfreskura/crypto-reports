1. **ftm, tomb, ftm network**

    @Riquacrpt0 --- *I have a noob question — thanks for your help.  I bought ftm on kucoin and binance us. I withdrew from both places via the FTM network to Metamask FTM network.  Is it possible to just use the FTM on the FTM network for staking and LPs? Or do I need to move them to the native fantom wallet? I want to use the FTM with my ledger, but every guide I look up seems to have FTM on the Eth network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/645114)
