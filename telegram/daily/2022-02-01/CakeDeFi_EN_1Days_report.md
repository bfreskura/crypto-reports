1. **dfi, rewards, pool**

    @Tracey --- *Does the APR of 59.85% reduce by 1.658% every 11 days like the DefiChain?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170236)

    @zachgax --- *I freeze Staked DFI for 10 years to get the 2X rewards, but I don’t think LM freezing has such additional bonus.   So I normally freeze LM for 12 months, as it seemed to me to be the best balance of fee reduction, additional % rewards and duration.   LM is something I might want to remove and reinvest in other pool. 10 years is too long a time.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170501)

    @Tracey --- *thanks. assuming I own 1% of the total pool (USDC/DFI)  and pool size is  100million, and APR is 50%, this means that I will get 1% of the 50million rewards = 0.5mil.  I will get 0.25mil of  USDC, and 0.25mil worth of DFI. The number of DFI tokens I get, will depend on the market price of DFI at that time.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170250)

    @Spikeboibeigel --- *Hmm, in that case I am confused. I have been testing it around a week. But the rewards are not near that on avg 90-91%. More like close to 60%. (I have frozen for 120 months)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170500)

    @mm_phoenix --- *you can swap directly to cake dfi in dusd, because you thought you could buy it cheaper somewhere, it became inconvenient. ☹️* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170208)

    @Aimun_J --- *Hi. I am trying to deposit DUSD into my cake wallet however the wallet address is flagged as invalid. Can I not transfer DUSD from my MetaMask in order to liquidity mine?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170190)

    @Kassius84 --- *The dUSD coin you need for the Cake DeFi and the DeFiChain is only available on Cake or DeFiChain DEX. I guess you bought another ERC20 token called DUSD which is not compatible with the DeFiChain.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170195)
