8. **solana, second, throughput**

    @B_sh999 --- *Ddos attack is not new. there are many solutions to identify the fake requests before leads to affecting the network performance . Solana team also considered Ddos  attacks they will overcome this issue in the next updates. It's not a big problem* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325488)

    @neirenoir --- *I think Solana is a total engineering blunder. Not sure how they have managed to get away with it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325483)

    @B_sh999 --- *Solana distinguishes itself from other blockchain projects through its Proof of History (PoH) approach to reach consensus. As a result, the Solana network can scale and process a faster transaction throughput of up to 50,000 transactions per second (TPS). The platform is able to support a hypothetical upper bound throughput of 710,000 TPS on a standard gigabit structure and a throughput of 28.4 million transactions per second on a 40-gigabit structure.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325480)

    @neirenoir --- *Basically, whenever a transaction is sent to the network, all validating nodes vote on it to determine if it is valid or not. Those votes are usually done via a side channel because there is no point in recording all of them, but Solana does them on-chain.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325475)

    @B_sh999 --- *Don't agree. Solana main net is beta . Ddos attack could be occurred on all blockchains.  U mentioned finding node for attacking is easy in POH but even without  consideration  a solution  for this, due to increasing the amount of node validators attacking on all them is impossible . Just like what makes attack on Bitcoin  is very hard and costly* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325484)

    @lovingcrypto_mytelegram --- *What's the road map of 2022 any updates, upgrades, any chance of besting solana in the coming years...I strongly believe in avalanche to be better than ethereum in the future* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325864)
