    @gicappaemme --- *Hello everyone! I am the guy who developed AI Alghorithm for NFTs price estimation! I have a question for admins or polygon devs:  I told with some devs in ChainLink ecosystem looking for someone helping me to run a node.   In the while I am thinking about providing other kind of jobs as node in order to make it more various and usable. So I am here asking this:  **Except from NFT Price Estimation (that we Re already going to integrate) is there any other off-chain data (about NFTs or even not) that I could provide from my node you would need? I am able to scrape ‘static’ data and retrieve estimated data through Machine Learning algorithm. Every answer is appreciated! Thank you all !* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/370676)

    @Sylvarantt --- *Interesting question. If I were you I'd browse https://chainlinkecosystem.com/ecosystem, fetch Chainlink integrations by "NFTs" and see what sort of data or computation service are those projects using Chainlink for and reflect on where are the niche market opportunities as a data provider* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/370702)

    @Sylvarantt --- *Hi there, the Chainlink Labs team doesn’t offer timelines for development targets. Although you can assume that a certain solution will be deployed on a given network when the engineering team considers that it's safe and fail-proof to do so 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/370734)
