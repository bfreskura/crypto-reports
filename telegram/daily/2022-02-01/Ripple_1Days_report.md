    @Akon924 --- *XRP price has done a fantastic job of staving off any further selling during the week. While it is not yet out of the woods, it is positioned for a bullish reversal candlestick against a strong support zone. The first test that bulls need to pass is achieving a daily candlestick close above the Tenkan-Sen at $0.65. However, downside risks do remain. Despite the strong support in the $0.60 zone, there remains an absence of convincing bullish continuation. So far, buyers have rejected lower prices but have not stepped in enough to support higher prices* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047894)

    @marianmp --- *I've heard something amazing this days* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047665)

8. **decentralised, validation, operate**

    @CARXVV --- *Well, I believe, decentralizing validation is critical for a blockchain, they can basically reverte anything if they agree. I assume Bitcoin wallet concentration is a consequence of the mining process and early adopters, not sure why aren't Reipple nodes more distributed or open for anyone to participate.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047895)

    @gerrymchugh --- *Eth are changing to concensus too, in fact they don't really seem to know what they're doing yet. BTC has most supply controlled by very small number of wallets, so while the validation is decentralised the supply is most definitely not.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047892)

    @CARXVV --- *Well, if you choose people that operate them, that is not very descentralized, anyone can mine bitcoin or Eth, I wonder why is it that way* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047891)

    @gerrymchugh --- *I dont know that for definite, maybe someone else here does but even if it is, they don't own/operate them... Still decentralised* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047888)

    @gerrymchugh --- *Each node can select the validators that it trusts, can't get a lot more decentralised* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047903)

    @JesusJames --- *that is not anyone's business but mine* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047690)

9. **hoax, great hoax, brilliant**

    @marianmp --- *Either it's something great or a hoax* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047656)

    @<UNK> --- *It's a decision to believe at the end of the day. There's tons of sources to support whatever narrative you decide to pursue.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047637)

    @Juicynela --- *I don't know , may be , do a research on goggle , that's why it is created* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3048323)

    @<UNK> --- *Not sure I agree with that dichotomy, there's a lot between great and hoax :) smart people rigging for themselves isn't neccessarily a hoax. It can still be wildly successful for everyone else.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047657)

    @<UNK> --- *It's a brilliant focused distraction on top of a brilliant solution to a real-world problem, I feel you* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047641)
