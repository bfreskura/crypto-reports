    @mahib45 --- *Hello!  Mainnet is launched! It was launched in March 2020 and is successfully working and updating, (done billion transactions already) as well as getting new functions. For your understanding - Yes, we were first calling it beta because it was just launched and not every function was available.   We will keep the suffix "beta" for a year or so because we want to check the mainnet stability in long term and make sure we have a great product. But it's a working network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/927728)
