1. **info, update, coingecko**

    @Mojomagick --- *Your charts are not realistic.  You constantly remove the wicks from your charts.   Look at AVT chart for example.  https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0xcdff6ddfc9e4807c9927fd58708c2ef3484cc305  It looks completely different on the Etherscan chart than on your chart.  https://etherscan.io/dex/uniswapv3/0xcdff6ddfc9e4807c9927fd58708c2ef3484cc305  I have asked multiple times to resolve.  I keep hearing the team will look into it and nothing happens.   When will this get fixed?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330052)

    @Madsumo --- *I have tried both UK and US servers and it is the same for both.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329742)

    @JoeyDieleman --- *This has to do with cloudflare not trusting the vpn its ip address* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329739)

    @Madsumo --- *Hi.  Recently my laptop was compromised and so I rebuilt it from the bottom up, i.e. complete reinstall from the OS up.  I have then set all apps where possible to 2FA and installed Norton360 plus their SecureVPN service.  On startup, with the VPN enabled, I can still access all my apps, exchanges, and wallets but I cannot access the DEXTools App. I get an error stating your site has security to stop security attacks. If I stop the VPN, connect to your site first, and then restart the VPN, it is fine.  I believe this is then bypassing my VPN as the session was started without it enabled.  I am not a security expert but is there anything I can do so I do not have to stop and re-enable the VPN?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329736)

    @napascual --- *Maybe try with different countries then uk/us as well, check that the ip comes from a trusted ASN* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329752)

    @napascual --- *I remember a user that had norton 360 vpn service using non trusted ASNs. I encourage you to use a different vpn provider* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329750)

    @JoeyDieleman --- *You could try, if the vpn supports, to connect to another node/country or try another vpn service* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/329740)
