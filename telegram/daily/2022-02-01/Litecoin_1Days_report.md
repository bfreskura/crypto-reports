2. **mweb, signal, version**

    @cloudlite15 --- *I sold recently because I was told mweb was never going to be happening* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2055970)

    @YuumuraKirika --- *Except they don't need more... It's pretty plug and play. They just have to run the new node software. They try to keep the code up to date... They also get part of each tx in fees.. MWEB included... If it doesn't reach 75% by a certain time, it's going to activate anyway according to BIP8, so I'm sure they want the tx fees from MWEB txs.. else they be missing out on some moolah* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2056278)

    @coblee --- *Only mining pools signal. Exchanges will likely not use MWEB, so they won't need to upgrade. But they should upgrade their edge nodes.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2056228)

    @YuumuraKirika --- *@coblee do you guys have contacts for the major exchanges? Emails or something? How hard is it for exchanges to signal for MWEB in terms of backend work on their end?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2056206)

4. **market, research, prices**

    @Congressional_Liason --- *Pick your prices and think for yourself with facts given by Charlie and David, along with other successful crypto people.   Telling people to research and think is honest. You all go back to wrecking noobies if that's who you are. I follow my thoughts.  Also, the person who said community sentiment doesn't affect price should read the Stanford study that came out two years ago (you probably already have.) 😂   Have a good day, everyone. Pick your prices and find where the research is without the fud/fomo.  ✌️* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2055808)

    @Congressional_Liason --- *Your posts I have a hard time comprehending.   For others, please do your research, pick your prices, and focus on facts, in my opinion.   I have a series of bids in at these prices; being long and using the coin, I’m good whichever way it goes.   Being a market-wide dip, I’m accumulating many coins, and given the history unfolding, I am glad to accumulate. Even in dips, I’m way ahead anyway, and for me, it’s a great time to collect.   Enjoy everyone, research, critical thinking, and when I see fud Increasing with good news, I’m a contrarian from the incessant fud here and buy.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2055790)

    @Furkan --- *Let's not be too pessimistic.  With the Asian opening, the market moves a little.  Uncle Powell spooked the market.  However, investors have already priced in before these statements.  Support point works fine.  I believe we will easily see 145-174-224 levels.  With the opening of the US stock market, the down nasdaq direction is important for bitcoins.  I am an Ltc investor with spot and leverage.  good luck everybody* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2055176)
