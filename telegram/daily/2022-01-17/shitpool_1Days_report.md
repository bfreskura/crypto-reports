2. **trading, btc, l1s**

    @wonderwarraior --- *I don't think it can outperform buying early in L1s and holding for many multiples but maybe it works for you. thanks for sharing anyways* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717117)

    @Horselorde --- *Tbh I wouldn’t sell rn. Everything is down aside from a few coins.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717380)

    @wonderwarraior --- *Why do you day trade L1s sir? it's very simple to buy L1s low and sell when 5x-10x and move to the next one* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717111)

    @brendanplayford --- *I also like selling into positive money flow as the green shows money flowing-in. I like buying when money is flowing out which would be red* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717102)

    @BeAMightyKing --- *I'm thinking similarly, as it's hard for me to see most top 20 L1s seeing significantly more upside without BTC 1st clearing $69k, past $100k & beyond.  But maybe this is old skool thinking and perhaps we've transitioned to a market where BTC & alts move up together without a surge in BTC dominance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717142)

    @BigBombo --- *Dont take this one too seriously lol, but if an earnest SoCol effort for decentralised onlyfans / patreon etc actually happens, I like the EV @ this puny market cap.

    @BigBombo --- *"I was living in a 34sqm condo.  All I had was a pathetic 49" 4k tv with gross to look at LED tech.  I had one 27" monitor only, a 4 year old dell, thick bezels, with a 4th gen intel i7.  I couldn't even afford a watercooler for it.  I was using a $10 mic for teamspeak.  My desk was so small it restricted movement through my condo and was attached to my kitchen table.  But I believed in bitcoin, and I kept longing the dips 10x or more on mex.  Now I live in a 120sqm condo.  I have 2 oled TV's, one of them 65".  Multiple monitors.  An office with a massive sit stand desk and my mic is professional quality on a fully articulating boom stand.  Because I believed in mewn and BTFD like I am now again too"* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717506)
