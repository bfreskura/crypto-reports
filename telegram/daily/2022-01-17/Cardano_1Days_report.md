1. **pools, sundae, rewards**

    @TheC --- *To acquire Sundae through ISO participation, can we delegate ADA on Daedalus?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/769846)

    @glitch04 --- *As long as you are holding an asset that fluctuates it will continue to do so, Unless you are planning to sell all now and wait for that asset to drop and re-buy at a lower price later ada will continue to rise and fall with the markets.  So If you want to take some profit from the holdings you can just send the amount you want to convert to stables to the exchange directly. You may have to claim your rewards first depending on how much that is you want to send over to the exchange.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/770494)
