5. **like, polygon, cex**

    @adhamalkhaja --- *I think polymath does something similar* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36545)

    @mislavjavor --- *Agreed, for low fees at this time, though - I can recommend the Polygon network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36387)

    @<UNK> --- *You kinda answered to this already, but I'd like to recommend atleast some CEX since ETH is congested all the time. I understand that something like Kucoin is now "pointless" until there is enough progression from this "new start", but there is some smaller CEXes like MEXC or AscendEX where you can get listed quite easily and can have decent userbase & volume* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36383)

    @panos_dim --- *Cool, lowcap, do you guys have any competitors in other chains?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36544)

    @<UNK> --- *Yea Polygon is fine, but TBH I never found it more convinient to use than some cex where I can quickly to trade different pairs and withdraw the coins I like. But maybe I should learn it better:)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36398)

    @matejmz --- *Just wondering - wouldnt it be better for them to deploy on Polygon?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36366)
