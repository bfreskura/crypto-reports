    @theblokchainbaker --- *Market cap is an illusion. It's not real. The only thing seperating real from fake is your belief. FTM is what will propel financially independence to the future, the concept, the action, the future. Either hop in the bus or walk to your mc Donald's shift in the snow uphill 6 miles.

    @wealth24x7 --- *apologies if this has been asked before. I would like to stake FTM in the native wallet. FWallet only accepts Opera, not ERC20. I have FTM on an exchange which only sends using ERC20.   Does anyone know of an exchange which accepts both, so I can send FTM using ERC20 to the exchange and then transfer it off using Opera?  Is there a better way to do this?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/633519)

    @Connor --- *Any UK guys have a decent way to buy FTM now that Binance blocks most bank accounts? I’ve sold a big chunk of shares and the 4% + that KuCoin charges is too high. Any advice appreciated* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/633908)

    @pajamasfreak --- *There is nothing we could as it is a custodian wallet owned by Binance. We have no control on users’ wallets..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/633750)

    @Lucy_hill --- *Hi Everyone Hope you're all well.  I have made quite a major error with a substantial amount of FTM - and I am really hoping someone can help.  I sent FTM from Binance on FTM, to a friends exchange wallet - but the address he gave was for USDT and network Bep20. Also the exchange I sent to doesn't support FTM. Unsurprisingly, he hasn't received the FTM.  The transfer completed. And the transaction ID looks as though its an exchange - as the coins were moved out shortly after. And there are a lot of transactions linked to the destination address. I have contacted his  exchange (I also have an account with them) and they have their technical team looking into it... Anything else I can do?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/632268)
