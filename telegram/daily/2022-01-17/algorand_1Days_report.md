4. **exchanges, usdca, foundation**

    @S --- *Going to try asking again… Is the foundation working on getting USDCa and USDCt added to the major exchanges? Coinbase, Binance, etc? If so, what does this process look like? Is it up to the Algorand foundation to pay a listing fee and facilitate building it the infrastructure? Are Coinbase and there like deliberately disallowing USDCa on their platform due to their partnership with Ethereum products? It would be great to know why tors hasn’t happened yet…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332944)

    @S --- *I’m not trying to find it for myself, My point is that I hope it’s a priority for the foundation to get USDCa listed on the top tier exchanges. That would be worth more than any marketing deal they could make for expanding exposure to the ecosystem.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332954)

    @tfv_algo --- *And where can we sell aside from that two* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332850)

    @TheRealGiulio --- *Fully agree. USDCa and USDta on big exchanges would be huge!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332977)

    @MackDenver --- *I got you but it is working fine at my end. This is why I asked you to reinstall the wallet. If it doesn't work, I will forward the issue to the tech team.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332907)

    @Cesnili_Kanka --- *Read the top message it's giving you. It saying the service is unreachable. Like their servers are down or something, or your telecom provider is strangling the connection, etc. If it's a legitimate message, and not a local issue, then no matter how many times you reinput your password or install the wallet it will give the same error.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332906)

    @cityrttg --- *What's problem with login in app Android? Always wrong my password* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332896)

    @anh Toan --- *ALGO will become the “Google” of cryptocurrency  January 16, 2022 at 21:59 287  Facebook    SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci says that Algorand (ALGO) will challenge top competitors in the crypto industry just like Google did in the early days of the Internet.   In a new interview with Digital Asset News, Scaramucci said that he is investing heavily in ALGO because he thinks it will displace many of its competitors.   “Currently, I have invested $250 million in ALGO.  I think Algorand will become Google.   You and I, when we were kids, we logged onto the Internet with AltaVista.  We use Lycos, America Online – even Prodigy, if you can remember that.  In 1998 the company was called Google and people were saying, “Why do I need it?  I've got all the other tools to get on the internet," and then people say, "You know it's faster.  It has machine learning, more common algorithms.  It gives better results.  So Google has convinced people, and I think that's going to happen with Algorand."   Algorand is a PoS blockchain that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) for financial services.  This smart contract platform even challenges Ethereum, aiming to speed up transactions with lower costs.    “I think when the big businesses get into the tokenization side of the market and they start working in the DeFi world, they will need something as scalable, secure and decentralized as Algorand.  So they won't have to worry about inflation - the erratic deflation of the methods they are using to exchange value.   Algorand for me is the future.  More and more people will study it in depth and make a decision to choose it.”   In an interview on CNBC's Halftime Report in December, Scaramucci said that Algorand has the potential to topple Ethereum, the leading smart contract platform today.   At the time of writing, ALGO is trading at $1.39.   algo   Source: Tradingview   Join Bitcoin Magazine Telegram to follow news and comment on this article:* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332946)

9. **address, contract address, contract**

    @karlos1878 --- *Does it not have an address sorry for the newby question* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/333185)

    @MackDenver --- *In the Algo, you don't need a contract address like ERC-20.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/333195)

    @nferdazel --- *Depends, Algorand token does have contract address for ERC20* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/333186)

    @NightAlgorand --- *there is no contract address as Algorand is not ERC* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332972)

    @angelo9007 --- *There is no contract address as Algorand is not ERC* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332839)

10. **minimum, account, balance**

    @Vitualcop --- *Every account on Algorand must have a minimum balance of 100,000 microAlgos.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332776)

    @mlats4 --- *guys how is myalgo wallet minimum requirement counted?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332774)

    @Vitualcop --- *A single Algorand account is permitted to create up to 1000 assets. For every asset an account creates or owns, its minimum balance is increased by 0.1 Algos (100,000 microAlgos). Before a new asset can be transferred to a specific account the receiver must opt-in to receive the asset. This process is described below in Receiving an asset. If any transaction is issued that would violate the maximum number of assets for an account or not meet the minimum balance requirements, the transaction will fail.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332787)

    @Vitualcop --- *Minimum is also determine by asset holding your account has* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332783)

    @mlats4 --- *but how does the minimujm balance increase, thats what im asking* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332781)

    @Vitualcop --- *If ever a transaction is sent that would result in a balance lower than the minimum, the transaction will fail. The minimum balance increases with each asset holding the account has.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332777)
