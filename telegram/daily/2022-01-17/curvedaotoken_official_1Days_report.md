    @Jack --- *I always think about selling and making some profits but something stops me every time* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/19741)

    @panamq --- *Greed is a HUGE obstacle to overcome when daytrading. And the truth is, there's always another play.

    @Kross --- *Plan your trade. Trade your plan. People often get angry when they make a profit and close a trade, only for that play to keep going higher.

    @Jack --- *You don't scare me Whales. I've got no hobbies, no family, no friends, no girlfriend. I've got literally nothing else to spend my money on. The more you dump it the more I want to buy, and the more you let it pump the less I want to sell. can't be reasoned or negotiated with. I'm the player at the poker table who can't be bluffed because he doesn't have the first fucking idea what he is doing anyway. I'm your worst nightmare.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/curvedaotoken_official/19240)
