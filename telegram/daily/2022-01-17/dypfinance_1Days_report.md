    @iamJubi --- *Hello. Done digging into your wallet, apologies it took time as etherscan is under maintenance.  You added liquidity (DYP-ETH pair) and approved but I think you did not deposit on the farming pool as I can not find the deposit transaction you made. Remove liquidity here https://app.uniswap.org/#/remove/v2/0x961C8c0B1aaD0c0b10a51FeF6a867E3091BCef17/ETH* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/240122)

    @Justin --- *I have a question about an old farm I deposited 27 Defiyield into about 14 months ago. I cant see it list in the dapp but can see it on Etherscan..can I still remove it and sell it back to Eth?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/240118)

    @timdyp --- *If you removed your funds, it's impossible to get it back. You can get the assets affected by the IL only if the value of your deposited assets will recover in value, this can happen only when you still providing liquidity. Again, before joining farming and providing liquidity, you should read about IL and understand the concept.  https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/240572)
