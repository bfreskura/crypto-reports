3. **ifo, cake, ifo pool**

    @collfopp --- *I have been staking in the IFO pool since the DPT offering, which I missed.  So I have a decent amount of IFO credits available for FROYO.  All CAKE that I own is in the IFO stake pool.  Do I need to have additional CAKE to commit to the IFO when it opens, or will I be able to use what I have staked?  Also, if I unstake some of my CAKE from the IFO pool right now, will my IFO credits decrease?  Appreciate any help anyone is willing to offer.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2277295)

    @Ceddi200 --- *No you don’t loose your stake cake. Instead you earn more.
