    @ZoltanAtom --- *Hello.sorry for late answer. We do not have direct contact with their team. As you well know, at Cosmos each chain sovereign. So I do not have details of ongoing project.

    @StevenM1314 --- *thanks. Is it possible to get new project tokens by staking at any node?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/476047)

    @Cordtus --- *You send a single tx 'claim all rewards'  The only downside is you can't use the one button/one tx claim and restake function on cosmostation. You'd have to do it for each validator* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/475300)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *You may find many liquidity pools with high apr at Osmosis Amm or Sifchain Dex;  https://t.me/osmosis_chat  https://t.me/sifchain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/475345)

    @SoulRa1ser --- *Osmosis Crypto Review 2022 : This Is The Year Of DeFi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVYV3MyEFVY* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/475146)

9. **validators, validator, commission**

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Make sure you avoid exchange validators! Other than that...The best validator is always subjective, here are some factors that might help:   - Commission Rate:  This is the % of earned rewards that go to the validator. Not the % of your total stake, just to eliminate that confusion.   - Self-Bonded rate:  This is the % of bonded ATOM that belong to the validator. Think of this as their skin in the game.   - Decentralization:  Choosing the smaller validators helps to decentralize the network which improves security overall. Again, decentralization should be a priority. On this point, centralized exchanges are not the best choice as they don't really support the network at all.   You can learn more about each validator in their profiles on the wallets and explorers.  The 8-10% is almost for everyone, feel free to use this reward calculator  https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/cosmos  Commissions can be changed anytime so keep an eye on your validator via telegram or twitter* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/476019)

    @AtomJazz --- *Usually selecting a validator between #10 and #150 is best to support decentralization of the network* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/476062)

    @WaterWorldArt --- *So basically Avoid exchange and 0% validators?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/475174)

    @a1sunny --- *Means which have 5 to 10% commission those are suitable?  And is there is any risk involved? Like chance of losing of our token during delegation ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/476021)

    @AtomJazz --- *Yeah that's usually the case but avoid exchange validators* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/476090)

    @Vadim_everstake --- *Usually validators owned by exchanges may be excluded as well as validators with 0% fee. Other conditions regarding threshold, date of snapshot etc vary from drop to drop.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/475170)

10. **ibc, gaia, asset**

    @bitangel84 --- *Yes, I don't remember the endpoint but is something like ibc denom trace* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/475235)

    @Hindrhasha --- *Sorry, bit new to coding in anything other then R. What is the client, is that an api? Or its only possible to call IBC names within gaia?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/475241)

    @Hindrhasha --- *Seems to be the same, but thanks! Btw is there a query for ibc asset codes?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/475233)
