    @riqua21 --- *I know but I was wondering if race does play into perceptions about an account being a bot.  I'm sure it does but it's unconscious* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325172)

    @mrlovin --- *Why each bot takes profile pictures of Chinese woman?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325154)

    @AgenteBanderas --- *Hello everyone, I have a question, do you by chance know if in the next updates of the algo wallet there will be the possibility to buy algo directly from the wallet (something like metamask whit eth) without going through the exchanges?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325382)

    @mrlovin --- *If I remember correctly you can’t swap directly on Metamask as well. You still have to go to a dex and just approve the transaction with Metamask. It works the same with algo. You go to a dex and approve the transaction with the algowallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/325385)
