1. **epoch, stakepool, switched**

    @... --- *hi if i unstake and restake on the same stakepool on the same day will i still receive my rewards?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762065)

    @ChrisSTR8 --- *You will still get rewards from your old stakepool while you wait for the re-delegation to get effective. Yes the wait is the same for the rewards to come from the new pool* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762275)

    @... --- *I delegated to a different pool* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762093)

    @... --- *I already switched pools you see* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762091)

    @JohnGoldberg --- *If I re-delegate a stake to another stakepool does it take 2 full epochs before I can earn rewards again or does it take the ongoing epoch + the next epoch?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762274)

    @DimkaT --- *After you switched pools, you have to wait two epochs for new setting to apply.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762094)

2. **native, assets, send ada**

    @glitch04 --- *If you don't have native assets then it will say you don't have assets to send, if you are just sending ada you have to put in the value you want to send less the transaction fee or it will fail* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/761965)

    @DU69SYP4 --- *How about kraken , i hold ada coin on there?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762003)

3. **chat, verification, probably**

    @JuanIncognito --- *Why doesn’t this Cardano chat have the verification symbol?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/761941)

    @pool0AAAA --- *Hi! Seems it is here: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1852/README.md  It doesn't work because link are like this "[CIP3](../CIP-0003)", so probably it should be change as "[CIP3](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0003)", so full link should be there and then it should work. Probably you can make PR, if not let me know and I will create one.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/762322)

    @mindmisled --- *I haven’t looked at this chat for days and there was 300 messages waiting….* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/761942)

    @mindmisled --- *How comes this chat is quiet? Are there other channels?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/761939)
