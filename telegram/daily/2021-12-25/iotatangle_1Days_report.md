    @baskinbeagle --- *Can somebody explain if the staking system of firefly wallet still leaves the right or ownership over the coin (iota) to the wallet owner while staking or it's like leaving coin to a typical defi farm where the lps could be compromised due to the system of a dex?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/302214)

    @Kox88x --- *If you get tokens in prestaking, it looks like binance is specifically blocking the Iota transfer so that they get as many tokens as possible.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/302227)

    @sy-subrc --- *10.000 IOTA is literally 1ct. So I guess you mean MIOTA.  Anyways, there’s not much you can do: 1. Wait for Binance to resume withdrawals (which they promised should be happening today or tomorrow, but I wouldn’t bet on it) 2. Swap for whatever, get it to another exchange, withdraw it from there 3. Don’t participate in the staking* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/301925)
