    @Giorgio --- *Hi guys, I just opened a software version of solflare and something doesn't sound me so good, but of corse because I have no knowledge. At the moment of login, Instead of asking me for the password, it asks for the mnemonic, with no password, and then it shows me a list of solflare wallets based on the derivation path. Then I cannot select mine but just click on ACCESS and It goes directly to my own wallet. How does it associate it, since I haven t select it? Is there anything unsafe in this? Thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/878031)

FTX will automatically wrap your crypto in an SPL token to be used with the Serum DEX. Please note that to convert wrapped SPL assets back into their native chain, you can deposit into FTX and withdraw the unwrapped assets.  🔗 https://ftx.com  Telegram: https://t.me/FTX_Official* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/878699)
