4. **airdrop, solo airdrop, solo**

    @nephiasah --- *Solo airdrop has been distributed. Most people think its no use to keep xrp now, so they sell* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3029600)

    @MalFalconBC --- *Here's a zinger for everyone to learn from:  I've held 15,000 XRP for 9 months then decided to use a bit of it to take part in the Songbird/EXFI airdrop.  Well immediately after that snapshot I lost over half of my XRP fund.  Then to try and recoup so.e of it, I swapped the remaining half for SOLO (at around $5) hoping it would pop up just before the snapshot (like Songbird did)...but it didn't and now I'm down half of that too.  One lesson here is...leave your damn bag alone!!!!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3030010)

    @DeltaOMI --- *Xrp community only want airdrops they think they is smart 😂😂😂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3029701)

    @CryptoPit21 --- *For some people, there's more money to be made selling some of their XRP at $1+ leading up to this airdrop and rebuying at maybe 80-85 cents or less then receiving the solo drop with the low ratio that will be given to xrp holders. JMO..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3029518)

    @PWRAIDI --- *No one in there right mind would buy XRP for the airdrop, they would buy the other token as the ratio is much higher. 🤷🏻🤷🏻🤷🏻* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3029704)

    @XRPSEEKER --- *Can anyone define what this solo airdrop is all about? I’m new to the crypto space and have no idea what its all about. I hold XRP too, what am I supposed to do?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3029835)
