1. **value, lp, loss**

    @James --- *Hi - I have had a similar issue to those above - I deposited 500 BUSD into the 30day v2 BSC yield farm on 15/12. Despite both dyp/bnb increasing in value since then - my deposit LP token is now only worth 250 USD (which even allowing for the DYP 25% still represents a significant loss). My understanding of impermanent loss is that if both tokens increase in value, it is very difficult to lose money by impermanent loss.. is there another explanation of where this money is being lost? I had a similar experience on the 3 day v2 BSC platform. My colleagues on avax / eth have not experienced this* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232953)

    @Arslan_Farrukh --- *IL is more than actual gains. Not understanding how this thing is working by decreasing LP balance on consistent basis. Although APY is good but not worth it against IL. Bad experience 😐* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232997)

    @Jeffzon --- *The work done by the DYP Team so far, is highly commendable. Hence I never complain about the developments made. I however, like to advise that due to the losses incurred by IL, they should consider listing idyp token on CMC or CG. This will help investors have better understanding of fluctuation of their profits as they will be able to see the idyp vs wbnb price which influence the daily farming rewards.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233211)

8. **day, reward, idyp**

    @memiamang --- *If i get reward by dyp then number of dyp must be increased day by day* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233133)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *You are still getting reward in DYP and not iDYP* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233131)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Yes you get the rewards in iDYP and the price of iDYP is converted to DYP based on market value. So based on iDYP and DYP price, you can see 100 DYP today and 150 or 50 DYP tomorrow. If the rewards are not claimed, they can go up or down.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233126)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *The rewards shown are in USD value based on iDYP price so when you hit claim, the iDYP is swapped for DYP and sent so this USD value depends on market price of iDYP, the rewards will be +/- depending on your earning and USD value of iDYP* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233124)

    @memiamang --- *Why the dyp reward is not right* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233112)
