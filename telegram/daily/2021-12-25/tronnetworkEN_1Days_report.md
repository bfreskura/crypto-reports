    @PiterSpain --- *You MUST send them to Binance.com (Deposit TRX ERC20)  You MUST swap old trx to TRX mainnet on TRON Blockchain  If you sent your old TRX from eth wallet to eth wallet, now send them to Binance as I said before.   If your token is hidden and you can't see it in your trustwallet app try adding a custom token    Contract address: 0xf230b790E05390FC8295F4d3F60332c93BEd42e2  Decimal: 6  Symbol: TRX (You may need to add it as TRX2, if you get an error)   After all this process you will get TRX Mainnet in Binance.com.  Pay attention: TRX MainNet runs on TRON Blockchain. Withdraw using TRON/TRC protocol and use Tronlink.org app as wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/tronnetworkEN/3788676)
