    @Cordtus --- *Yeah just send it back to osmosis chain. Then you can swap it or whatever you want to do on osmosis which is an actual functioning dex with rewards.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/459680)

    @mahyarblue --- *I asks me to connect to Keplr* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/459430)

8. **cosmostation, keplr cosmostation, wallets**

    @Cordtus --- *Cosmostation or keplr wallet are the recommended wallets. Also ignore all DM right now they are scams* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/459177)

    @HectorianFrog --- *Best wallet for to access cosmos?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/459569)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Sure. Cosmostation is the recommended wallet. But you will need to use Keplr wallet to claim your airdrops. So you always have an option to import your mnemonics seed to Keplr. (If someone DM to you,block and report⚠️⚠️⚠️)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/459408)

    @piantif --- *Hi, do you use any app to track your assets on cosmos blockchain? is there an API?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/459501)

    @SoberaniaFin --- *Ok. So there is no way to trade Cosmos right now, is there? Neither in any wallet with exchange, right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/459420)

    @Mathiax --- *Or you can also use cosmostation wallet on mobile.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/459770)

9. **admins, channel, scam**

    @Cordtus --- *No. They have been claiming "relayer issues" for about a month now. I don't want to FUD but I'm starting to get pretty suspicious of this. If it really is just relayer issues then it is trivial for them to spin up their own relayer. I as well as many other people have brought this up in their telegram channel many times now and every time I am completely ignored. Others have suggested things like buying out the LUNA that has been trapped on their chain for many weeks now but they still ignore every time. Admins will not even respond to the complaints.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/459885)
