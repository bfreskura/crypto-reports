1. **swap, tokens, pancakeswap**

    @MadameX39 --- *Hello. Sorry to disturb you but I've got a problem. I made a swap on pancakeswap for a contract. It said that was Mobius but when I try to swap it back I could not. The error was: “The transaction cannot succeed due to error: execution reverted: TransferHelper: TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED.” Is there a way to recover my money or to find more info about the contract?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2220770)

And patiently wait for the next one. Which doesn’t have fixed date* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2221752)

4. **cake, cake price, 80**

    @Flower9999999999 --- *I am trying to figure out why CAKE price has continually declined since May and especially since the launch of NFT marketplace  I wish there was some sort of onchain analytics to verify 2 things:-  1. The stakers earning CAKEs, what do they do with the earned CAKEs? Do they sell their CAKEs to stablecoin or compound it?  2. People who buy NFT’s on PancakeSwap, did they sell CAKE in the previous 3 transaction to buy BNB to purchase NFT’s and do majority of CAKE holders buy NFT’s on PancakeSwap or non CAKE holders?  The answers to both questions will reveal the truth behind the decline instead of Chefs labelling any criticisms as FUD.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2222196)

7. **sell, impact, price impact**

    @J --- *Guys someone help asap!!! So I am in a coin that locked it’s sells until this evening. I own most of the coin but thr price impact of my sell would be about 75% so by default the sell button is greyed out and I have no option to sell. On the other hand if I turn on expert mode I can in fact hit the sell button but I can’t sell yet bc they are unlocking it later. I want to know if expert mode will allow me to sell regardless of price impact??? Someone plz help this is urgent🆘🆘🆘* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2222220)

    @theillfatedjack --- *I see still recommend selling a little though, a 75% price impact is really high, I'm sure you need to input confirm button for that* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2222237)

    @J --- *I could but everyone is selling at the same time when the sell button is unlocked by the devs so I wanna dump* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2222227)

    @theillfatedjack --- *Can't u just sell a little by little no minimize impact* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2222224)

    @J --- *Devs unlock sales @1pm thats why i want to know beforehand bc I can’t sell rn and I wanna be the first to dump* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2222374)

    @J --- *If I try and dump on a low liquidity coin the price impact is too high for me to sell and the button is greyed out. If I turn on expert mode the button says sell anyway. Expert mode should allow me to sell and bypass the cap of 15% price impact and sell my bag which will have a 75% price impact correct?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2222370)

9. **sell, liquidity adding, adding**

    @TomorrowlandForLife --- *Try all of these steps  1) Increase your slippage, the higher the better  2) Increase your gas (15, 350000)  3) Remove any decimals, use whole numbers and round down (e.g. if you are trying to sell 592038493.20395, type in the amount 592038492 manually)   4) Use a different wallet (safepal, trustwallet, metamask)  5)Try lowering the amount you sell. Some coins got max transaction limit.  6)Ask the coin issuer to either lower the auto liquidity adding threshold or turn off automatic liquidity adding completely.   🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 7)If none of the above work, you've probably bought a coin you cant sell. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨  Here you can check whether the token you bought is a scam.

    @Ceddi200 --- *It’s always important to carry out the necessary due diligence and analysis for warning signs before depositing your funds anywhere.  If you send your funds to bad code contract, or scam token , or very low liquidity you can’t sell it.
