1. **dextools, dex, dextool**

    @matarazzee00 --- *Yes i don't no i want you guys to show me how to list it on dextools* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316985)

    @FredericDEXT --- *This is the first step to make a more complete and modern UI, but many things are still in progress, and the community feedback is the best way to improve and the guide we always followed at dextools since the beginning.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317317)

    @darkstorns --- *I haven't seen a significant change in functionality yet, this is not an update but an idle.  The number showing the price is too small, need blue red as before to know the price movement, I think the dev is imitating some other dex site, while dextools is number 1, who else needs to be imitated?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317980)

    @Chris --- *Any way to revert to the old DexTools?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317101)

    @starkess --- *I launched a project and it showing no symbol in dextool 😐* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316323)

    @benedictarchibongIII --- *hey is there anyone that could refer me to someone that has the capability to update dextools links/score? need to get it updated at the soonest convenience, thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317090)

2. **token, tokens, old token**

    @solidask --- *Hello, is it possible to remove old version (V1) chart of a token that migrated to new version (V2)?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316912)

    @D --- *nice work making the old token available after making a new one* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317036)

    @D --- *how do i convert my old token to new token?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317002)

    @FredericDEXT --- *It's there in the token info section* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317614)

    @justdhu --- *I cannot use the new one it’s just another bogged version bring back the score on tokens lol you guys used to bait out the scammers etc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/318047)

    @rpoole69 --- *If you could do a single transaction to turn them into a specific token, that would be valuable IMHO* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316566)

3. **favorites, hide, favourites**

    @stanes --- *A lot of people asked to have the percentage change for the favorites.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317953)

    @hopiumvictim --- *Who in the right mind would want to redesign the "favorites" section* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317949)

    @Simon --- *Another small thing, default sort order for favourites is last added and it doesn’t remember after I change it to name* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317530)

    @Simon --- *Guys not sure I’m a fan of the new layout, basically I want to be able to see my favourites so I can track current prices of my investments and a single chart together. I don’t care about anything else. All the guff on the left with pool info, dext score etc is fixed when I rarely care about any of it, it reduces the space for the chart and my favourites now have to float on top of it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317457)

    @napascual --- *You could hide Favorites by click on the close button* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317111)

    @schwingk --- *I wish favorites was how it used to be, I hate scrolling to see my portfolio* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317414)
