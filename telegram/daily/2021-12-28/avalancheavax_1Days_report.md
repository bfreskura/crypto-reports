    @Nicolas_A --- *There are plenty of fake tokens that are sent to users. The Avalaunch airdrop was for validators / delegators and the snapshot was taken months ago. I believe there is a 1 year period before they are airdropped* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/317763)

    @EnduroV1 --- *Another Avalanche Offical group popped up on my Telegram - they saying there is airdrop. Page looks real with 11000+ members. However smells fishy to me?

    @UBIllin --- *Hi.  I tried to get support from the forum but they forwarded me here.  I sent LINK to the  AVAX bridge contract but this was due to a bug in metamask, if you look at my wallet all the transactions on the ETH Chain are top the same address, when I switched to AVAX network to send to the same address on the AVAX chain metamask did something weird.  I found another person on the forum that had the same issue.   Is there any way to recover this?  0x9be0859edc38919ec32d882ccf4eb035ed74a5d29bbe20627c6e834d111ec05d* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/318194)
