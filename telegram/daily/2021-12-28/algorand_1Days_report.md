1. **input, 100, send**

    @idontknowwhattouseforusername --- *hello, algorand wallet team, there is one issue, when sending out ALGOs, one has to input a number, right, the input area by default has way too many trailing zeros, e.g.  if you input 100, the actual input becomes 0.0001  to send 100 algos, you have to input 100000000   please fix this, thanks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326571)

    @idontknowwhattouseforusername --- *so from wikipedia:  Traditionally, English-speaking countries employed commas as the delimiter – 10,000 – and other European countries employed periods or spaces: 10.000 or 10000.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326669)

    @Tiny_Philosopher_784 --- *So you can only send 3.1 out of the wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326315)

    @hope9999999 --- *Eight 0 after dot is normal on exchanges. Remember this is token that currently equal to aprx $1 and it’s not real dollar which equal to 100 cents.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326585)

    @idontknowwhattouseforusername --- *i think i am very clear on the issue.   1. when you input the amount of algo, the keyboard pops up, the keyboard has only 0-9 and a delete button, no "DOT"  2. if you want to send 100, you have to type 10000000  3. if you want to send 100.5, you have to type 100500000  4. if you want to send 103.45, well, try that. i don't know how to ..  5. if you want to send 50.001, as @xM3Dx said, then try that ... i don't know how to ...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326629)

    @idontknowwhattouseforusername --- *even so, i don't think it is a good idea to set a 0.00000000 by default, if one needs to input like 100.123456 they do that in a human way. not by some default settings* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326595)

2. **paper, usb, storage**

    @patrick_crypto --- *for funds that you would consider critical - the key should never be stored digitally - basically ever. no photos, nothing.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326505)

    @patrick_crypto --- *there are numerous examples of people doing something like this (or variations) only to later forget their password or secret trick… don’t overestimate your memory* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326463)

    @hope9999999 --- *😗😗😗 in some hard situation like flood, volcano, will you run asap or you try to find your metal plate? 🤪🤪🤪* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326504)

    @Martin --- *Hey community , I was wondering if there is any way of increasing the privacy of an account? Cause at the moment everyone can know what assets are being moved from and into an account, right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327023)

    @MackDenver --- *That's why it is decentralized, and Algorand blockchain is already secure. Others can see what you are transferring but nobody will know who is transferring.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327029)

    @NightAlgorand --- *Algo is definitely better than ADA.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326780)

    @Martin --- *I am not saying anything against Algo (I love Algorand), I am just trying to figure out if things are as I am imaging them or not…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327041)

    @AbuRidwan16 --- *Hi folks!  How many % is the rewards for staking algo?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327099)

    @MackDenver --- *Hello Lucid, I have already answered it. Please check the rewards FAQ to get better understanding.   https://algorand.foundation/faq#participation-rewards-* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327014)

    @Crypt0Playa --- *I subscribed about ~33K Algo and the MyAlgoWallet Governance portal says estimated rewards to be just shy of 6000 tokens. Is this right or an error in the portal?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327119)

7. **ledger, wallet, governance**

    @TheSondler --- *I have ally ALGOs on my Ledger Nano S. As i seen there in no chance to connect my Wallet-ID with the Governance Programm, because Ladger don't support note section. Also the offical algorand wallet don't support the Nano S :-(* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326713)

    @khunpon --- *Now I had 2 address on ledger One for yieldly Another for this governance #2* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326374)

    @Chris --- *So, If i have lets say 250 algo in my ledger could i gov' with that and then when my other algo gets free, could i gov' with the rest or is it just the "first time" amount you could only subscribe to gov' like you cant just add on to it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326392)

    @Chris --- *so quick question, before i subscribe; if i connected my ledger to myalgowallet, and then decide to subscribe to the governance, do my algos from my ledger get taken out( not planning to remove any algo)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326371)

    @get_rekt_noob --- *I’m confused. When I search the list of eligible governors, my wallet is no longer listed there, despite the fact it was there for the first period.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326558)

    @Atbash1984 --- *So it is necessary to create a new wallet to go for the governance program?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326717)

8. **governance, period, governance period**

    @KAPIBAYSIDE --- *Does it make sense to put up a small amount of algo for governance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/327151)

    @MackDenver --- *If you have kept ALGO committed for the first governance period, it is also committed for this round too.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326548)

    @get_rekt_noob --- *For governance do I need to commit Algos every voting period? So committing them once won’t just keep them committed?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326546)

    @MackDenver --- *Yes, these ALGOs will be distributed to all participants of the second governance period.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326985)

    @Rizxtarrrrrr --- *Governance means native token of algo??* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326737)

    @Nokuaru --- *You have to commit your ALGOs for every new governance period every three months. Not for each voting session inside the gov period.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326567)

9. **tokens, city, swap**

    @Croketaa --- *So those are the only existing tokens on algorand at this moment?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326869)

    @AgenteBanderas --- *Hi everyone, I'm developing an app with @Davide99 and We would like to ask if you know any official APIs that can be integrated to convert and buy algorand in app, or if you know any other solution, like coinbase api's or transak. Thanks in advance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326572)

    @Croketaa --- *Hey guys, anybody here knows about maricoin token? Its related to algorand Miami acceleration but that’s all I can find online, it’s supposed to be already launched in algorand* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326865)

    @mcmaxims --- *If you speak of tokens, there are many more which are not listed there. The link Night sent you lists all "big" projects. There are many small projects and tokens as well.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/326875)

    @BranTaco --- *If anyone here is into NFT photography projects Algoworld. io has been a project on Algorand since early April 2021, using https://app.algoworldexplorer. io for trading/selling cards. I’m doing a giveaway of three different city cards if anyone if interested they earn $AWT AlgoWorld Tokens.
