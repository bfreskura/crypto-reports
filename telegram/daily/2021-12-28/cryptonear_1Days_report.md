4. **pool, unstake, meta**

    @memoriesadrift --- *Correct me if I'm wrong but If you stake short term you lose more than you earned if you unstake instantly. If you stake long term you are just introducing extra risk by having stNEAR instead of NEAR, i.e. your rewards are delegated by meta pool (dApp) instead of near (the blockchain)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/253304)

    @kv9990 --- *There's delayed unstaking feature too on metapool 😅* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/253310)

    @FritzWagner --- *11) The relationship when staking directly with a validator node is 1 to 1. When you stake with Meta Pool it is 1 delegator to 52 validator nodes. So you are helping the NEAR Protocol become more censorship resistance and decentralize the network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/253309)

    @aniketbose945 --- *Ref finance wnear to stnear then unstake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/253389)

    @larry_lang --- *just gonna add that we do have a borrow protocol called Oin.finance maybe u can have some research about it:  https://twitter.com/FinanceOin* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/254052)

    @FritzWagner --- *you dont have to unstake instanly so you wouldnt lose any money. Also you get META tokens, also you are able to do liquid unstake, and the network is more decentralized thanks to metapool because the NEAR are going to be split into different nodes* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/253306)
