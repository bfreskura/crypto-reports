    @FUTURE --- *Recently, I had been feeling like I wasted the opportunity that the pandemic gave me to learn, improve, find new hobbies, etc. I see a lot of folks at work, a lot of friends, and even some family members that have worked on degrees, learned new skills, picked up new hobbies, etc, and I felt like I had really just dropped the ball.   Then it dawned on me: I've learned a lot about the stock market and cryptocurrency/Blockchain technology the past almost 2 years. I am not an expert; far from it, in fact. And I wasn't totally new to crypto, but the last time I did anything other than sporadically hold BTC was around 2014/15, and my has the crypto world changed a lot! All of that said, I'm no longer completely perplexed when I see a lot of jargon being thrown around. I don't understand 100% of the quality DDs, research reports, white papers, etc, but I do feel much more confident in either knowing where to look for more information or what questions to ask.   I could have done a lot more research, that's true. But it's important to keep things in perspective. I DID improve myself over the course of the pandemic, I just probably won't see the results of it for a while. I will keep learning, hanging out with you fine folks, and eventually free myself from traditional financial institutions (or at least have fun trying!). Thanks, everyone, and I hope you all enjoy the holidays!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/25751)
