    @S --- *hola hello !!! if i buy ohm now in a exchange or uni is the migrated version already ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135734)

    @Kred88 --- *for each OHM u migrate, u lost 50$.  I migrate 100 OHM of the value of 434$ to 100 OHM of the value of 385$* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135910)

    @G --- *Why is the price of ohm v2 lower than v1* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135178)

    @Whynotbit --- *So, wait, you made 10 ohm along the way by doing arbitrage, but still complaining that the migration is making you lose money.  I'm not sure I understand you here.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135922)

    @Kred88 --- *why OHm v1 value is 434.05 $ and OHM v2 value is 385.45$ ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135899)

    @Nostress04 --- *Ohm v1 costs more because the price accounts for missed rebases, that you would get by converting to v2.. You would get more of sOhm v2.  It will not be 1:1* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135966)

6. **apy, rewards, rate**

    @amkuo --- *can you explain halving the APY please, not so familair about it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/136399)

    @cryptosmyptos --- *what is the actual correct apy as the pinned message says its wrong* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135694)

    @Arthur --- *Hey, Ive a stupid question, but when the APY indicates 6000%, does it mean you're supposed to wait one full year to earn it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135724)

    @JM --- *The yield payment at every rebase is what dictates the APY.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135365)

    @JayJayJayMa --- *Oh no! Just 1000% APY. Lets panic sell. 🤣* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/136068)

    @kaezer --- *But apy is correct so ill give it a go with a small amount and see how it goes i guess* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135368)

7. **price, ohm price, ohm**

    @RichR7 --- *You are missing OHM's price is going down.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/136099)

    @kevalbaba --- *How reliable is the price of ohm on the app? I am looking at an aggregator and the average price from various sources comes to ~420* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/136018)

    @Ahmad --- *Just wondering, why does Ohm price keep dropping? Are people selling?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135785)

    @Enjoytaira --- *Why price down if market is quiet days ago?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135582)

    @Legislative_Justice --- *Why should I buy ohm instead of time? Looking to invest 25k* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135313)

    @sticks_na_beany --- *Why is the price on blockfolio completely different to the actual price* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135726)

8. **staking, bonding, bonds**

    @Adrian --- *So people with millions don't get millions of ohm from staking (some of which they sell). Just a thought, seemed progressive/democratic to lessen the influence of the few wealthy.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/136331)

    @Irnweirdo --- *however with bonding you get 4.8% and you funds is lock and hope the market not crash withing 5 day period* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135655)

    @FLankarooo --- *Let’s just say that we consider bonders as simpletons ( arbitragers ) assuming they will turn around 5 days from now and Sellit. That being said with bonds V2 OHM will be autostaked for the 5 days* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135650)

    @FLankarooo --- *Are you familiar with how bonds work ? 😁* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135647)

    @Irnweirdo --- *now bonding for frax is 4.86 and buying and staking immediately is 5.52 for 5 days ROI* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135646)

    @Irnweirdo --- *SO why some one incentivize to do bonding when he can get more by buying OHM and staking immediately* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/135648)
