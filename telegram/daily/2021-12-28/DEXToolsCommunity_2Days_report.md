## 🔝 **Top keywords and related messages**

1. **token, tokens, pool**

    @FredericDEXT --- *Same as before , at token info tab* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/318154)

    @Kian_hashemi --- *Because everyone who trades has valuable seconds to check the tokens on the favorite list.  We had access to the previous version very quickly, but now we have to click a few times to be informed about the status of the tokens.  This is very bad for the trader.  I hope users think fast before their numbers dwindle.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/317746)
