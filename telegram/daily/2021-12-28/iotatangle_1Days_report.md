    @Marco --- *No, its very simple…the exchanges want your shimmer and assembley Token 💁🏻‍♂️* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/303174)

    @Sailor --- *Forecast about 14% of IOTA's total supply around 39,000,000Giota was permanently locked on Iota's original network unable to migrate to current network because owner lost passphrases According to statistics on the Chrysalish.iota.org network, after 7 months of operation, only 85.27% of IOTA tokens have been transferred by owners from the old network to the current new network, the operation time only takes 5 minutes, so at Why is this Iota token accounting for 14% of the total supply so dormant, especially tomorrow will start the STAKE program to receive Shimmer and Assemby tokens, anyone give comments to abovementioned matters?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/iotatangle/302853)
