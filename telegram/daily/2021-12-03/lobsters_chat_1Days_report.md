    @pierreleroux2 --- *because it can be easily manipulated. but for some purposes, spot price is the only solution. if you're minting lp tokens for a uniswap pool which can be immediately redeemed, for example, it would be foolish to use anything else* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/304089)
