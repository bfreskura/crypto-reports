    @barodahoang --- *1. Due to the difficulty of using DEX and paying high network fees, how do you plan to bring people that are used to CEX to your platform? Our forbitspace platform currently offers the best price and optimizes fees for users. Forbitspace is a very user-friendly platform, even for new users. Moreover, we collect prices from various DEX exchanges currently presenting on the market, so it's easier for traders to use instead of having to switch to multiple websites* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/polygonofficial/906432)

2. **cru**

    @ludeclay --- *The CRU token is a utility token and has several use cases within our ecosystem.

    @ludeclay --- *2) if 6 months run out than the storage providers full filled their service based on smart contract. This means nodes could delete the file without getting punished for it.

    @ludeclay --- *Thanks to our highly efficient MPoW (Meaningful Proof of Work) mechanism there is no need for expensive and energy consuming GPUs or high-end CPUs. All you need is a reliable internet connection, a CPU with TEE functionality and some free storage. Currently there are around 13k CRU paid to miners (storage providers) on a daily basis.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/polygonofficial/906053)
