1. **metapool, staking, meta**

    @mv_the_realone --- *Larry, I lost a huge amount of money $30k, swapping on ref finance. They are not helping. Who can I contact on near team to help with this?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/285524)

    @GeorgePro1 --- *1. MetaPool (https://metapool.app/dapp/mainnet/meta/#)  distributes the tokens proportionally to the validators, so no worries which validator to choose. 2. You still get ~11% APY on your $NEAR, and withdraw NEAR whenever you want without waiting (with fee). 3. On top of that you get MetaPools $META token payed out daily 4. You get stNear which can be used on other DeFi applications such as app.ref.finance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/284041)
