2. **staking, apy, staking rewards**

    @iamaturtle123 --- *Hi guys, programmer here new to the Blockchain. I am thinking of creating a tax preparation app for yieldly where I put in an address and it spits out a list of interactions with the yieldly staking app along with the price of yieldly on the day of the transaction. My question is how should I query the blockchain? It looks like the algo explorer api would do what I want, but I also see that is deprecated and frowned upon. Would I have to run my own algo node to do this, or is there another api I should use?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332161)

    @RalphCraig --- *You may have malware that replaces addresses when you cut and paste.  Try cutting and pasting an Algo address into a notepad and see what happens.  If it occurred without you sending anything perhaps your seed phrase was compromised.  Did you store it electronically at all?  Perhaps as a screenshot?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332500)
