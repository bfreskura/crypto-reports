    @rambo_dev --- *why is dextools becoming so fucking trash nowadays, from bad to worst, tokens launched for more than 30 mins and dextools still says liquidity is not added. past few days transactions even jammed and not moving. Totally unreliable. If this continues, dextool is going down the drain. Compare to poocoin that never once had any issue.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324283)

(About 200k volume in those 2 candles total and chart makes it appear like theres been 0 volume haha)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324627)

You can see the first 3 minutes look like there’s 0 volume but there’s actually a tens of thousands haha* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324613)

    @nate102 --- *https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0x7dec9d12a30eebe5c570fa1603a00c5fc705b5a7, I haven't checked if this one is legit either but regardless u can see there is clear volume (around 400k) first 3 minutes and price in trade history first 3 minutes is different on chart. same bug* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324625)
