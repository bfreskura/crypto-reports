4. **airdrop, airdrops, website**

    @TicoJohnny --- *Well, i'm not sure what to say to be honest, I don't have control over each user's security tolerances and it's up to each project how they airdrop* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/473613)

    @TicoJohnny --- *There's at this point dozens if not hundreds of dev teams, they're all witnessing what is happening and how things are being done, each airdrop seems to be getting smarter but there have been a few exceptions* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/473618)

    @Gabriele21R --- *I'm too late I know hope I will get some future airdrop..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/473244)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Hello,All you need to do is stake your Atom. Eventually you will need to use Keplr wallet to claim your airdrops.   Couple of important point you need to know that do not stake your Atom with exchange validators and validators which offers 0 commission.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/474350)

    @TicoJohnny --- *Ultimately, it's your decision to do what you want with your wallet. If your risk tolerance allows it then do it, each developers know the multiple methods in which they can airdrop and it's literally up to each sovereign chain to do it how they want to.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/473623)

5. **cosmostation, keplr, use**

    @Lee_CryptoNFT --- *so most people use keplr as their wallet, but instead one could use cosmostation wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/473284)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Ofcourse!  Lots of! For example, Keplr wallet is the way to connect Cosmos dexs such as Gdex,Osmosis and Sifchain.   If you don’t use Keplr wallet, you will not able to claim your airdrops.   Cosmostation mobile app also many features which are given to users more flexibility and accessibility to all Cosmos.   I do use both Keprl and Cosmostation. Both wallet core teams are Cosmos contributors.  For example ;you will not have any issues which many other third party wallets had after network upgrades!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/473863)

    @hempshox420 --- *do i have any risk to stake my cosmos? and how can i find a reliable validator?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/473404)

    @AtomJazz --- *Yes, it's the best Cosmos wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/474226)

    @TicoJohnny --- *I see, is there a reason he doesn’t use the phone app? For pc we recommend Keplr, the chrome extension, for mobile we recommend cosmostation. The online web wallet doesn’t have all the functionality of the app, I could recommend you to either import your mnemonic onto cosmostation app or Keplr or contact cosmostation support team* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/474099)

    @David_H99 --- *Good afternoon I have a question which I would appreciate some help and advice with -  Is there a cosmos explorer that will show when staking rewards are earned ? When I look at mintscan I can only see transactions when I receive and send or stake and unstake - but I cannot see the build of staking rewards over time?  Thanks in advance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/474407)

    @AtomJazz --- *If you're staking on trust wallet and then import your mnemonic code to Keplr, staking will continue. Wallets are just UIs, staking is done on-chain* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/473259)

    @MPLD35 --- *Hi, can someone clarify for me why some chains have small gap between on chain params and real block time in % for staking and others have bery small? Is it effectivness of validators?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/473690)

    @JCFishing --- *Why would you ask a cosmos public forum to see if it’s good to buy cosmos now?  It’s like going to a car dealership asking is this car a good buy now?   People are nice here, that’s why they don’t say wether to buy or not.  if you do not know this project, stay away.  If you do then do waht’s best for yourself.  In other chat, they will tell you to buy 39, 89, 149 or 589…..here we ask you to dyor.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/473567)
