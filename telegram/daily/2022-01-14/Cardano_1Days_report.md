    @glitch04 --- *The following is an update that was posted:  Due to an unusually large number of potentially invalid CA proposal reviews, we’ve taken the decision to delay the Fund 7 community vote on submitted proposals, originally scheduled for Thursday the 13th of January at 11 AM UTC. The vote will now take place on Thursday the 20th of January at 11 AM UTC.  This allows us to conduct a flash assessment round with the help of Veteran Community Advisors. We appreciate this may cause some trouble and apologize for any inconvenience.
