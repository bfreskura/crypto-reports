    @Zakkah --- *I'm considering using XUMM. How's your experience been so far using it? Thanks 😁* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039834)

    @gerrymchugh --- *Yeah, definitely - I stick mainly to XRP and Solo* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039840)

    @gerrymchugh --- *I love it, been using it a while. Easy to use and very handy for the airdrops etc. Use XRPtoolkit to manage it from laptop* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039836)

2. **case, court, date**

    @philip_218 --- *It is already extended to feb 28 and court decision will delay to aug or sept 2022 according to hogan* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039800)

    @DhCryptoGroup --- *Good luck bro! Hogan just mentioned that case will get resolved in aug/sept. But again we run 8x with lawsuit intact before so still i say $5 is doable 🤞* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039867)

    @Rektallstar --- *And even then there isn't likely to be a conclusion on that date* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039702)

    @ShaLtran --- *Yeah it's not like there was a major event happening at that Time, like a world war.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039366)

    @esmocodecom --- *do you know when is the last date for the desicion ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039705)

    @marianmp --- *When moon - soon  When 1$ - soon When win case - soon  When 100 $ - this lifetime* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3040079)

3. **ripple, sec, documents**

    @Top_of_mind --- *SEC Must Surrender Hinman Email on Ether to Ripple, Judge Rules https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/14/sec-must-surrender-hinman-email-on-ether-to-ripple-judge-rules/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3040016)

    @Rektallstar --- *I think we will see an agreement favorable to Ripple before the year is over. It won't be a "win" in the court records, but for Ripple and for us it will be a win.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3040129)

    @EML1993 --- *The SEC tried to prevent these documents to be disclosed and therefore become part of Ripple’s evidence. Now that many of these documents are declared “not privileged” and therefore can be disclosed and become part of Ripple’s evidence, to me is a win.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039770)

    @Tinkabellagal --- *Documents that the SEC didn't want Ripple to be able to see can now be seen by Ripple. These documents most likely will be extremely damaging to the SEC's argument. Perhaps to the extent that a settlement may be the only option.  Also Entry 9 is granted in full which is the email sent to SEC staff containing the attached handwritten draft of the hinmann speech (where it was claimed that BTC & ETH are no securities)  https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1481739856069939203?s=20* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039793)

    @Zakkah --- *Brad said he is open for settlement as long as SEC provides clarity I.e. XRP is not a security.   SEC sued Ripple for $1.5bn! Thought it was gonna be an easy money grab! I'm glad Ripple is fighting the good battle.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3039871)

    @saca_rolhas --- *For that to happen, Ripple would need to be willing to increase burning rate. Maintaining cheap and fast transactions* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3040214)
