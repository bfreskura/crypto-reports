    @RangerApos --- *By interacting with smart contracts via Bscscan (without Pancakeswap interface), you can get your cakes back from PancakeSwap Manual Stake Cake Earn Cake (Core Pool)  For this, you have to interact with Masterchef, which manages the entire staking process.  First, go to the Write tab of the Masterchef Contract at bscscan  https://bscscan.com/address/0x73feaa1ee314f8c655e354234017be2193c9e24e#writeContract  Connect your web3 wallet (technically works with all wallets) to the page by clicking [🔴]Connect to Web3  Type 0 in the emergencyWithdraw box in the 4th row  Click on Write and confirm the txn transaction in your wallet plugin, after your transaction is confirmed on the network, all your Cakes are in your wallet.
