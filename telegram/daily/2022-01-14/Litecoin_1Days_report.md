5. **nfts, nft, blockchain**

    @RorschachTesst --- *Focus on one thing: payment medium and go all out on that shit. No point chasing NFTs, a new trend will emerge in 6 months.

    @RorschachTesst --- *What do you mean blockchain? Its just another token except that its non-fungible. I agree that every new chain is targeting NFTs but erc72 tokens are powerful enough without needing any side chains* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2046841)

    @JohnTheApostle --- *NFT is like Blockchain  Everyone wants it applied to everything but their own version of it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2046833)

    @Holamixy --- *Please what is the minimum confirmation for litecoin* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2045210)

    @morningzone --- *The Litecoin Foundation mandated Quarkslab to audit the implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol in the Litecoin blockchain.

    @coblee --- *comparing ATHs is pretty silly. Litecoin has been in an uptrend for 10 years. Yes, it hasn’t performed crazy like some shitcoins and have not outperformed Bitcoin. But it is what it is. I always tell people to diversify. No need to be attached to one single coin even Litecoin.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2045857)

    @Jim --- *How many lines of code litecoin has in total?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2046441)
