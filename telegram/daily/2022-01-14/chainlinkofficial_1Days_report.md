    @bond_dog_51 --- *Of course - Umee will be connected via IBC with close 30-40 other Cosmos based blockchains. These networks account for close to $80-100bn worth of crypto assets.

6. **metaverse, dao, mgh**

    @thenicolasweber --- *At MetaGameHub DAO we focus on the convergence of DeFi, Data and the Metaverse. As the Metaverse is currently hyped a lot, we believe that the next hype within the Metaverse will be applications on top and directly integrated within the Metaverse. Our core principle is ‚ÄúNavigating through the Open Metaverse together‚Äù. We do this with the following two aspects:   Building a decentralized ‚Äústate‚Äù in the Open Metaverse by acquiring and managing LANDs across various Metaverses such as The Sandbox, Decentraland and many more which our community governs and thus monetised via e.g. GameFi applications, event venues, art galleries and more. Building intuitive tools such as our evaluation tool for finding the fair price for your The Sandbox LAND and leveraging the data we have from an algorithm we developed to generate further revenue via our collaborations with Chainlink and Ocean Protocol to sell this NFT pricing data on their marketplaces. You can check out the tool in our dApp! The idea behind MGH DAO originated from 1) the fact that we want to onboard ‚Äúthe masses‚Äù via decentralized governance and monetization of LANDs as typically LAND in the Metaverse is owned by centralized parties and 2) we discovered that many Metaverse assets are lacking a fair and transparent pricing and therefore started developing the pricing algorithm.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364419)

    @marcromeron --- *How is MetaGame Hub DAO converging metaverse - dataverse?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364472)

    @marcromeron --- *Nicolas {Beware of Impersonators}: for this we have set up the various working groups which each can then subsequently apply for grants from the MGH DAO Treasury on a periodic basis to support the ecosystem growth. the working group application form is you path and after filling it out the DAO and respective working groups vote on new applicants. https://forms.gle/A6vCq2kxQpsdqp2o8 (here is the from)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364470)

    @marcromeron --- *Let's start with our first question....* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363844)

    @Kickthetrend --- *Is there any official platform to stake LINK?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363925)

    @todo_terreno_boy --- *Link‚Äôs staking isn‚Äôt live yet. What exchanges offer isn‚Äôt staking but lending* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364497)

    @Sylvarantt --- *Staking is not yet live. This article provides an overview of explicit staking from the Chainlink 2.0 Whitepaper. This presentation by Sergey discusses staking and the difference between implicit and explicit staking, while in this other presentation Sergey announced the team is planning to implement some form of staking in 2022.  As a rule the team doesn‚Äôt offer timelines for development targets. You can follow development progress via github.  Anything you find out there claiming to be "LINK staking" is actually some form of either lending or yield farming, which is out of the scope of this channel.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/364360)

    @marcromeron --- *Chainlink staking is not yet available. Other forms of staking offered by exchanges are actually yield farming, lending/borrowing, which is not endorsed by us and is outside the scope of discussion in this channel.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/363927)
