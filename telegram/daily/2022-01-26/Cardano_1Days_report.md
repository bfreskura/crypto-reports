    @Rambod20 --- *any one else having issues with their Daedalus wallet NOT ONLY syncing/connecting with the node? (I'm not referring to the node taking long time to reach 100% sync. it simply doesn't connect.)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775730)

    @Barbedouce --- *Hi, i'm using in the same time CCVault mainnet & testnet. I connect to minswap on testnet, then sundaeswap mainnet. When i do this, there is a mistake : minswap switch to mainnet, with the wallet i chose for sundaeswap. I think this kind of mistake can lead to some people lossing funds. Be carefull.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775893)

2. **price, sundae, swap**

    @Lgbeano --- *That pool is over saturated but you can still add ₳. I'm not sure if they will be included in their ispo or not, you would need to ask the sundaeswap team.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775772)

    @Voorval --- *Hello Can someone help me?  When i want to swap on Sundeaswap and for example i want to buy Sundea for ada. When i swap the price is for example 0.85 cent. But when the transaction will complete and  the price of sundea drops to 0.79. Will the transaction do it on 0.79 or still for 0.85* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775401)

    @Khalid --- *So many noisy cardano haters now on social media because of sundaeswap issues. Is it really cardano's limitations that caused these problems? or did the sundaeswap team rushed the release? Will there be an official statement from IOG addressing these concerns?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775892)

7. **improvements, epochs, eth**

    @apex_pool_spo --- *no, where did you get that impression from? it is actually going to be worse for a period, when other DEXes will also lunch, but in a few months (my expectation) we will see some big improvements. there is also a hard fork schedules for February (theoretically), I am not sure if the CIP31, CIP32 and CIP33 will be included or not. If yes, we will see the improvements much sooner.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775810)

    @Lgbeano --- *Yeah they only ran their ispo for 5 epochs* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775768)

    @KyR14c0s --- *yes but it took much more time than other days ... they were not supposed to fix this in this epoch ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775809)

    @ZeroOne101 --- *does anyone have thoughts on them only ipso'in for 5 epochs ? compared to most other projects length , and also considering the hype , that this is a pretty measly offering , no ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775777)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *there was a parameter change, but it was something minor, we won't see noticeable improvements from that (my personal guess).* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/775812)
