2. **avalanche, node, validator**

    @Sephiroth --- *All Avalanche Validator Nodes hosted on @Allnodes were successfully updated to the latest 1.7.4 version.

    @jjfirh --- *Hi all, when running a validator node, would the private key be stored anywhere on the disk unencrypted, or it will be just in the memory during runtime?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324517)

    @mikiro --- *No! You only have to point the avalanche wallet to your validator’s node id and enter a few details such as lock up time. Then you sign that operation once with your private key* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/324519)
