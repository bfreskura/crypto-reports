7. **ripple, partners, lot**

    @alfidanger --- *does xrp have multiple partners? is ripple x still running its business?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3046277)

    @Russty007 --- *Xrp is probably the only major crypto that the Fed can put their hands on because it’s a US company... so it can also become the “gold Standard” of crypto... but in a sense it makes it centralized because it can be governed by laws of the state* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3046020)

    @gerrymchugh --- *XRP is less centralised that lot of people think, Ripple do not run majority of nodes - most are run by others. Lot of people confuse token ownership with centralisation, because Ripple hold a lot of XRP, but in reality BTC and ETH are also mostly owned by very few large wallets.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3045961)

    @JustNNM --- *XRP has no partners, never had. Ripple is still building partnerships and buildings its network use footprint.  All info is on Ripples website and in the pinned messages* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3046278)

    @OliverBurton --- *Hey guys, do you think that XRP will be listed on some sort of decentralized coingecko site?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3046344)

8. **line, lower, support**

    @Briggslet --- *True.. the weekly chart shows we are on last year march support.. our resistance at present is geting lower and lower with every bounce. If we dont break through the resistance .. we are likely to drop through the support. Then lower prices are par for course.. and our next support line is at about 0.41* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3046321)

    @Jakes1993 --- *Do you think price will drop soon again? Any bad news out there?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3045722)

    @Briggslet --- *Stochastic has not given a buy yet RSI is still in down trend line ADX still has buyers out of the market however sellers are also starting to dwindle. MACD is down Awsome oscilator is down .. no buy signal yet. We are hugging the bottom line of the bollinger bands. We are below the 30 moving average an just above 20p moving average.

    @Voltaire123 --- *Nothing. We were going from 0.95$ dec 2021 to 0.6$ now.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3046119)

    @Jodxb2311 --- *Every number you can think of has been mentioned in recent weeks as and months.  If you only care about the price.   Do a bit of research and ask yourself a set of questions.  Do you see value in the price today,  ask yourself what your expectations are for the coming weeks months and years based on your research.  Make a decision, buy, sell, HODL  We are all trading against one another at the end of the day.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3045738)

    @ReiTeh --- *When the time is right. No one knows. But it will definitely hit 1 dollar* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3046337)
