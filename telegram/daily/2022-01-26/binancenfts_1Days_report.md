7. **cards, battle, card**

    @DmitriPro --- *Good question. In one Master card is locked 30 Battle cards. That's a reason, because relatively to the game itself, you are purchasing whole set of cards, just mint and play* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/444288)

    @DmitriPro --- *GOT utility:  1. The synthesis upgrade of the battle card requires the consumption of GOT and ERA Token, and more vital cards can get more rewards in the game.  2. Resetting the Master card also requires GOT 3. There will be GOT rewards for daily tasks and weekly competitive rankings.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/444178)

    @DmitriPro --- *After a player enters the game, they will need to purchase an NFT master card to summon the battle card.  After having 30 battle cards, he can engage in PVE and PVP battles. To synthesize higher-level cards, the battle card needs to consume GOT and ERA Token.  Thus, if you have a stronger card, you can get more rewards in the game.  GOT can be obtained through the trading market as an essential resource in the game. In summary, below are the use-cases of each token:* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/444176)

    @DmitriPro --- *Especially in the PvE mode that requires the use of different strategic combinations of Battle Cards to compete favorably.  Here are some additional info to know about the Master Cards and NFT boxes.  Each Box contains a random Master Card from 28 characters in 7 races in the game. MasterCard has four types: Common, Rare, Epic and Legendary. The probability of obtaining a Master Card of a particular attribute: Legend 1.2%, Epic7.8%, Rare 33%, Common 58%. Before the game goes live, holder of the NFT boxes will need to unseal the boxes.  Lastly, the Master Cards will be available for sale in the marketplace.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/444164)

    @DmitriPro --- *Master Cards will be valuable to holders in different ways. They can be used for accessing the PVP mode, PVE mode, Expert Alliance (daily) mode, Ranked competitions (monthly) and World Cups (fortnightly).* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/444162)

    @DmitriPro --- *MasterCards will also be used to summon Battle Cards everyday.  Battle Card has mining function. They will also be used to attack and defend with the passing of each round. Some cards will have characteristic enabling the effects that transcend rounds. Moreover, Battle Card are of four different qualities: common, rare, epic and legendary. The value of the Battle Cards stem from the fact that they are a mandatory requirement for playing the game.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/444163)
