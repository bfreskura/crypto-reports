1. **defi, security, cake defi**

    @zachgax --- *Cake is not an exchange or a spot trading platform. Why are people always so impatient to transfer in/out of Cake? LM,staking,lending are all long term services.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167950)

    @JL --- *Bigger platforms have no problems withdrawing within minutes, why cake so special? Because it's successful ? I doubt so, cake and defichain is full of bugs since day 1. A whitelist should NOT be needed to be checked further, period. This is utterly counter-productive.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/168026)

    @Bald --- *What's the cheapest way to deposit fund to cake defi? Currently I transfer LTC from Crypto.com to Cake Defi (Crypto.com take 0.001LTC fee). Then in Cake Defi I need to swap LTC to DFI (Cake take 5%). Thereafter I need to swap DFI to BTC & ETH (another 5% + 5%)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167860)

    @DmgBautista --- *That may indeed happen sometimes, but it's not a Cake thing.   As soon as the app is reviewed by the appstore and gets its approvall after checked for virus and other improper code, all depends on the app store to place it. Usually they try and do it fast, but sometimes it gets a bit of delay, its not a Cakedefi thing to control as it's a third party who is in charge for the distribution, in this case, google appstore.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167806)

5. **dusd, usd, demand**

    @DmgBautista --- *Yes DUSD has been dropping enough to offset the gain you felt in the DPDBC. DUSD has been trading already at almost 1,3$ usd aproximatelly, while currently is something around 1,1$ usd. It will drop further (my opinion only) once we get closer to the hardfork since many users are planning on exiting the pools, which will cause a drop in demand and further proximity to an actual 1$usd.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/168388)

    @DmgBautista --- *Hi! That update was an unplanned  emergency update, to stop the possibility of exploit the atomic swap beta feature, therefore the added time that many exchanges took to accomodate it. The current hardfork is a planned one, that aims to provide the tools to bring parity with USD to the Defichain DUSD* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/168476)

    @Manvydasm --- *Can dusd drop to 70-60-50% usd value if many users sell it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/168407)

    @mholdy.xpr --- *Can someone explain to me simply what dusd is? Is it pegged to the dollar? Any info or helpful forum would be appreciated!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/168424)
