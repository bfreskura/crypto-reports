    @IsaSal1218 --- *How is Polygon and Cortex related?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/polygonofficial/902189)

    @hypergraphi --- *But the core of Cortex is an HD wallet combined with a decntralized data structure.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/polygonofficial/902064)

    @hypergraphi --- *Sure. So Cortex was born out of the idea, much like crypto itself, that data should be decentralized and owned by the users.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/polygonofficial/901984)

    @hypergraphi --- *So Cortex is just that, a place to store but also, if you like, to publish all your digital stuff.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/polygonofficial/901992)

    @hypergraphi --- *Cortex is the way you access that structure, to take notes, to hold nfts or other assets, or to publish to a full web3 stack.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/polygonofficial/901998)

3. **polymeebit**

    @Polymeebitss --- *https://polymeebits.com  PolyMeebits is the first Meebits NFT on the Polygon Smart Chain, one of the fastest, safest, and most developed blockchains in the world!     PolyMeebits are a rare collection of 20000 unique 3D avatars that have 9 differing attributes!   The collection consists of: 5 Dissected, 10 Sandeep Naliwal (founder of polygon), 10 polymeebits (wearing Polygon and  outfits), 18 Visitor, 57 Skeleton, 72 Robot, 256 Elephant, 711 pigs, and 18862 Humans !   Minting a PolyMeebits costs only 75 Matic Coin (matic), where users will receive a random Meebit from the ones available.   The rarity of PolygonMeebits is determined by its attributes, description and type. Some of the 3D avatars are super rare!   PolyMeebits offers users the opportunity to receive a distributed part of the revenue by joining a pool!  5% for users who mint 40 PolyMeebits (up to 75000 Matic split between users) 10% for users who mint 120 BMeebits (up to 150000 Matic split between users)  The PolyMeebits platform works with the Metamask wallet, one of the most developed and easy-to-use wallet extensions!   Good luck and may the force be with you!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/polygonofficial/903774)
