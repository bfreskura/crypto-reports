    @thinkbig777 --- *1000% a year in OHM is good. but, will our tresury growth by 1000% ? will buyers at defi's buy ohm at that level ? to keep price per ohm static* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144683)

    @thinkbig777 --- *thats the right direction of thinking above backing and as I mentioned, speed of emission, if it will be higher then speed of fulfilling treasury, backing value will keep dropping down by ohm same as price* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144705)

2. **apy, lower, price**

    @Crypto --- *I was under the impression that as the Token price dropped you would be covered by the APY going up.   THAT DRASTICLY has not happened.  Did i miss something?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/145363)

    @Marco --- *If the price drops another 50% and APY drops down to 1000% , how long will it take to get my money back?  I bought at 600* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144556)

    @Marco --- *Hey guys is the runway APY shown on the dashboard wrong?  Dashboard says like 299+ days of 50x apy remaining (based off treasury ) .. but we are already at 38x  It seems a little misleading* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144322)

    @nfwaple --- *no bruh from your transaction it's very obvious someone transferred your assets out over a range of days* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/144478)
