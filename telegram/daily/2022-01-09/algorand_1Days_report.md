6. **scam, think, partner**

    @Ab_Del --- *@ admins: is it planned to have a MOOCS course on Algorand development ?

    @Skydr4k3 --- *I would like you to see entheos The project has been awarded by the algo foundation. But i really think it s a scam.

Please report it to the team or watch youself* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330802)

    @bernijw --- *Why would you think it is a scam? This is a fairly large software company. They could easily have contracts with these institutions. Their work with Algorand is only a tiny portion of what they do. I see no reason at all to call them a scam...if Microsoft were to partner on something with Algorand, would you call that a scam only because they also partner with the government on different projects?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/330804)
