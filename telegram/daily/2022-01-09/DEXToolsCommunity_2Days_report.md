    @stanes --- *You should probably step down from trading on DEXs until you understand how things work.  Blaming people for your own lack of research will never help you. Wish you the best 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/322643)

    @bonetky --- *Is there any issue in Dextools browser UI? Does not load for me* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323236)

    @zhengshui1977 --- *OK, thanks. This tool is pretty easy to use. If I only need to hold 1000, I am willing to buy it. I probably wouldn't consider it if it had to be paid monthly, thanks for the help* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323441)

    @zhengshui1977 --- *What are the requirements for a standard member now? The homepage says to pay $100 in DEXT/monthly subscription, -or -1,000 DEXT/hold. It says yes in the app 1.
