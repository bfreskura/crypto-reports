    @harrumphharrumph --- *Sorry, we do our best. If they are members of this group we can ban them otherwise the only thing we can do is encourage people to use the Report button in Telegram and/or send information to @notoscam ... We try to spread awareness with articles like this that Eric wrote.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/361511)

    @harrumphharrumph --- *Crypto P your messages are being removed by the bot. I think somebody is impersonating team members. They will never reach out with special offers. If somebody does reach out from the team it's likely to see if a project you are working on is a good fit for Chainlink technology. You would be able to verify their Telegram username (carefully!) with the list in the pinned message.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/361507)

    @Sylvarantt --- *Hi there Crypto P, Chainlink staking is not like the average PoS chain staking system, therefore you can't predict any sort of rewards (they are not really rewards, but payments for fulfilling oracle requests), since the performance of a node will vary from node to node. A highly reputable and trusted team of node operators might have access to a wide range of high value jobs than a node that just started operating, for example.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/361474)
