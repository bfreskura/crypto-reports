3. **bnb, tickets, participation**

    @c_hinmay --- *If I have 0.5 bnb in earn section and nothing in spot ... then? What amount will be locked?🤔* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426865)

    @Yuanxiaote --- *sry to be confused. Hi, in this mechanism, BNB can have 2 usage, one is for holding calculations and then the other is for participation of the sale. During holding period, you don't need to specifically stake your BNB, it will auto calculate even its in earn wallet or others. And on the other hand, if you commit for participation of the sale, the tokens(BNB) will be locked for the moment before distribution. After final calculation, all unused BNB will be returned though. So in short, you are only paying for what you have successful committed to purchase.--- In a nut shell, In Alice drop, you use BNB to buy mystery box.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426826)

    @Ivan11338 --- *I have 1 BNB on my account since yesterday, but it shows my average is 0.1))))) Do i need to have 100 BNB on my account to participate in sale?)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426947)

    @c_hinmay --- *So we have to get tickets, by holding min of 0.5 bnb in spot(bnb which is not in use rn), right? And later which tokens will be locked, busd or the bnb that we hold? Quite confusing, as busd is used for buying most mystery boxes🙄👀 @Yuanxiaote* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426766)

    @Yuanxiaote --- *Only the amount of committed participated tickets will affect the probability. The more participation tickets you commit, the higher probability to win. :) BNB holding amount will not affect the propability. Even though you might hold 100BNB, but the probability are same with others if you guys commit same amount of tickets* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426733)

    @Kenikky --- *Effie, Do I stand a higher chance to win the NFT if I hold more BNB? 🙂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426729)

    @anastasiaplane --- *Hi Amir! I see you follow Alice’s channels too 🤗 To answer your question, I would say we had our challenges too during the most horrible time of it. But we managed to stay strong, focus on DAO, and develop the game according to our roadmap.   I think people are more comfortable working from home in their comfortable environment, and how much better can it be to build a game in your pajamas?! 🙂  Thank you for being a part of our community!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426833)

    @NeyNeySGD13 --- *Yo @anastasiaplane and @Yuanxiaote, With this #AMA, I understand better the purpose of #MyNeighborAlice and the new sales system developed by Binance NFT, it is rather interesting, I have 4 questions (3 for MyNeighborAlice and 1 for Binance):  - @BinanceNFTs chose you today to present #MyNeighborAlice, how do you see and interpret this opportunity ? Is it a consecration that shows you are  recognised worldwide, or rather a springboard for your to become more widely known ?  - How do you intend to make #MyNeighborAlice grow in the eyes of the world, partnerships planned without counting binance ?  - How do you plan to keep the hype going, so that #MyNeighborAlice continues to attract people in the next few months ?  I have a question for you too @Yuanxiaote, once the distribution is done, and the NFTs received will we be able to sell them normally as simple NFTs obtained as before ?  Thank you for yours answers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426753)
