    @james7235 --- *I know this has probably been covered, but I've been looking and can't find an answer. dUSD is designed to be a stablecoin, but the current price is $1.28. When will we see it be a "true" stablecoin (i.e. $1) or am I fundamentally misunderstanding the role of dUSD in the ecosystem?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/151457)

    @freedfidotcom --- *If you want to trade your DFI here is one way if exchange DFI wallets are not up again yet: Send your DFI from Cake to DeFiChain wallet (desktop wallet or lightwallet) Use the DeFiChain DEX to convert to another coin (dDOGE for instance, withdrawal fees for DOGE from Cake are low) Send your dDoge back to Cake and then withdraw to exchange as DOGE on DOGE network  You can also convert to Bitcoin or Ethereum and withdraw that from Cake but withdrawal fees will be higher* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/151622)

    @fabioandreatta --- *Not 100% sure where the error is caused, either by dash or by cake. i can look into it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/151770)
