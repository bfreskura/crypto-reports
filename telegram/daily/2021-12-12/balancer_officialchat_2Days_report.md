1. **staking**

    @AdamNasution97 --- *Love the staking and the rewards!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/12763)

    @AdamNasution97 --- *Longterm the easiest and most lucrative way in opposition to trading for the majority is to just hold a coin / token. But most won’t even be able to do that as they will panic sell on the first market crash and never manage to hold until high gains.   Holding a token only for the price appreciation isn’t the smartest thing since DeFi, as your tokens can generate you an additional APY. That’s why staking is the best strategy for holders. The unbounding period prevents impulsive sell manoeuvres and helps to hodl longterm while generating also more tokens.  “Stake and forget” is just a saying for this principle as most check their wallets many times a day anyways.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/balancer_officialchat/12750)
