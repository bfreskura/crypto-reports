2. **im, 500 ada, transfer**

    @domib97 --- *Does anyone tried https://transak.com/ yet? This is from the TerraLuna ecosystem and could help mainstream people to get some ADA too, without big complicated exchanges. As an EU-citizen I can do SEPA Bank Transfer.  I think this is a game changer.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778048)

    @Coltey --- *yes you can, your ada is not locked* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778503)

    @Benjade --- *Where Crypto investors rush to buy ADA ? ADA still very low.. Fake news 😂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778031)

3. **rewards, pool, staking**

    @Lgbeano --- *Depends whether your other wallet is delegated or not. You register the wallets staking key, so anything in there is delegated.   If you move your ₳ from one staked wallet to another, your old wallet will continue receiving the rewards from that ₳ for three epochs, before your new wallet takes over. So you never lose out on rewards* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778529)

    @... --- *If i want to redelegate, how can i avoid losing rewards this epoch?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778195)

    @jack44sk8 --- *Just something safe to hold and staking in the pools usually when I want to use a dapp i send some to nami* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778554)

    @Lgbeano --- *Just delegate to a new pool, you will continue receiving rewards from the old pool before your new pool takes over. You will not lose any rewards* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778196)

    @Lgbeano --- *Just send them like normal. Your ₳ tokens are never locked when staking, they remain in your wallet under your complete control.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778504)

    @... --- *Will i not lose rewards from this epoch?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/778203)
