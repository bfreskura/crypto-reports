3. **token, dextools, tokens**

    @oni_o_n --- *good morning all, can someone please inform me how to update the dextools info for a token that I deployed* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330265)

    @napascual --- *There are 1M tokens around, you need to DYOR. Dextools metrics are automatic checks, they help you out, but won’t advise you to buy a token* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330766)

    @Killthezerotoken --- *how to update token symbol on Dextools?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/331150)

    @stanes --- *It's not how it works: We index all the pairs present on the DEXs we support. Once again: there is no listing process. We give some tools to users to downvote a pair if they think it's a scam. When you are interacting with some DEXs, you have to be extremely careful, most of the coins are scams or will anyway be valueless in the future.  Always DYOR, apeing any token without knowing anything about it is throwing your money away.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/331144)

    @JoeyDieleman --- *Above are the right contracts, as Stanes already gave too* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330882)

    @stanes --- *Yeah, that's absolutely not a pb, the issue is with the api provider but not related to your old contract. We will see what we can do.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330398)

6. **supply, bsc, dext**

    @stanes --- *What is important is the supply on Ethereum. Supply on BSC will never represent the total supply unless 100% of the tokens are bridged.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330890)

    @CryptoFatherBoard --- *This particular contract shows 2.8 million supply on BSCScan... 👇👇👇👇0xe91a8d2c584ca93c7405f15c22cdfe53c29896e3* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330877)

    @CryptoFatherBoard --- *This particular bsc contract has supply of 2.8 million token, while the other contract on dextool website says 200 million token supply.. Can you explain sir* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330874)

    @stanes --- *Both are rights, it only depends if you want to buy on ETh or BSC.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330883)

    @CryptoFatherBoard --- *Now i understand... That means 100% of supply not bridge... Am i right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330891)

    @CryptoFatherBoard --- *Okay, am just trying to learn how supply on Ethereum side is more higher than the binance side* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/330886)

7. **fixed, issue, hard refresh**
