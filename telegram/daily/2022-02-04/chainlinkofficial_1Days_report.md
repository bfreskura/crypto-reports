    @Sylvarantt --- *Hi Sam, you can always request a new price feed by clicking on the "Request price feed" button at the top-right of https://data.chain.link/ or even talk with several node operators so they can satisfy your on-chain data needs. Either way, if you are a dApp developer/ representative looking to integrate Chainlink, feel free to DM me more details about it and I'll be happy to connect you with the right people* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/371398)

3. **blockchain, financial, permissionless**

    @elifhilalumucu --- *👉🏻Stablecoins are a core component of DeFi that allow fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and other assets to be represented on the blockchain as digital tokens.   A stablecoin is a representation of an underlying asset and tries to maintain a 1:1 peg with it through various mechanisms🙏🏻* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/371498)

    @Sylvarantt --- *If you require a price feed for a liquid asset with enough market pressence and you use a centralized data source to calculate the price you expose yourself to flash loans attacks and price manipulation, that in the case of Money Markets would enable exploiters to empty your pools* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/371410)

    @elifhilalumucu --- *👉🏻In the DeFi economy, users can access a similar financial application stack as they would in traditional finance but without requiring the involvement of centralized intermediaries.🙂  👉🏻By using open-source protocols running on censorship-resistant and decentralized networks, DeFi applications provide global permissionless access, mitigate counterparty risk, and interoperate with other applications to enable more advanced financial products🙏🏻* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/371497)
