    @DmgBautista --- *Good morning guys! @zachgax it seems you had a rough night 😕   Unfortunatelly when users don't read the basics on safety and how to avoid scams, that are posted every single day several times a day, such can happen.  Sorry that you had to go through that.  All users, and once again, mods don't DM or call and there is no support on telegram. If someone sends you an unsolicited DM or call, whoever it may seem to be, just block and report. Plain simple as that.  Best regards! 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/172135)
