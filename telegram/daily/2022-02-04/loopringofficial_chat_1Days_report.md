    @Jowich67 --- *I'm self employed, play videogames, and can do crypto because I keep it simple.  Find the best project, go all in, and wait.  That's it.  Then you have time for whatever.  What is the best project?  I'll make it even more simpler for you.  Look into my profile.  I lost no money on the dip cuz I collect apy.  It's so simple, yet strangely most won't take it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/loopringofficial_chat/29919)
