    @Jimjim82 --- *Where can I buy Ohm? Pls give me contract add* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/178536)

    @nfwaple --- *the treasury does not need to buy your OHM, since the treasury owns the entire LP, it can just buy from its own LP till 1 OHM = 1 DAI* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/179012)

    @nfwaple --- *7 months ago we installed the Sherpa program into the Discord server. Olympus is a complex protocol to understand. The Sherpas stand as a united front in service of supporting the community and educating the Ohmies on how Olympus works and on the implications of its innovative mechanics. In the time since the Sherpa initiative began, the econOHMy has exploded in terms of users and builders; it's difficult to find a protocol in DeFi that isn’t using Olympus Pro and/or partnered with Olympus in some other capacity.   As the protocol has evolved and the community has grown, there is both more material to understand and a greater number of users trying to understand it. Our team of Sherpas in the Olympus server continues to grow and Sherpa led initiatives such as Learn With Sherpa and the Sherpa Library (SL) Medium Articles (https://medium.com/sherpa-library) have succeeded in getting countless Ohmies up to speed. However, we are constantly striving to increase access to and accessibility of key Olympus resources and educational material.   Today, it is with great joy that we present to you the SL Discord server. Fitted with a sleek ticketing system and an otherwise unassuming, read-only user experience, the SL Discord is designed to function as a focused learning center. Resources are well organized and easy to find. In the case that a visitor can't find what they're looking for, or need further help understanding a concept, our SL Curators are ready to help via the ticketing system. Swing by anytime, the SL library is officially open. https://discord.gg/PbZukUnVT6* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/178241)

5. **code, etherscan, github**

    @o_nexus_o --- *Why is the contract code on github different to that on etherscan?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/178903)

    @o_nexus_o --- *Well if I assumed it was hard-coded into the protocol, other people probably assume that* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/179070)

    @nfwaple --- *I heard that should be in line 577* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/178916)

    @nfwaple --- *I know you're sad, we all want the price to go up* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/178951)

    @EasternCircumcision --- *depends on the price, if it goes below backed price* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/178495)

7. **treasury, decide, treasury buy**

    @o_nexus_o --- *Well yeah the dev team could decide to use treasury to buy it back. I know that. I'm just saying it's not automatic, therefore not guaranteed. Because they could decide to just not do it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/179046)
