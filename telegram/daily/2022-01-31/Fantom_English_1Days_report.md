    @Riquacrpt0 --- *I have a noob question — thanks for your help.  I bought ftm on kucoin and binance us. I withdrew from both places via the FTM network to Metamask FTM network.  Is it possible to just use the FTM on the FTM network for staking and LPs? Or do I need to move them to the native fantom wallet? I want to use the FTM with my ledger, but every guide I look up seems to have FTM on the Eth network.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/645114)

3. **fantom network, swap, really**

    @Ambiora --- *That's really not good  for Fantom's growth man. We really need this if we want to be a market leader. Fantom has only 50 validator node which makes him not fully decentralized to attract DeFi protocols. We need FVM so that validator node can be increased in order to make Fantom really big. We had heard about FVM in 2018 but since then we are waiting for the same. And still there is not promising date. Hope you can convey these concerns to Andre Cronje* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/644413)
