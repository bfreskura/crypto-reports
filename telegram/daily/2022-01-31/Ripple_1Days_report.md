1. **xrp, price, ripple**

    @Likeitorpumpit --- *Why are You Tubers (Bit Boy) saying XRP is going to go to $10,000. Never will it go that high in a month of Sunday’s, or am I missing something here ??* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047590)

    @FTWASM --- *Even so. Buying the dip and dca only goes so far. At one point or another price has to go up to make a profit, at least if you're not daytrading. And with the lawsuit dragging on without any concreet results I think the mayority of xrp investors are fed up with all the "postponing". We want clarity.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047540)

    @JesusJames --- *Ummm i am the admin lol* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047682)

4. **ban, regulate, decentralised**

    @CARXVV --- *Well, I believe, decentralizing validation is critical for a blockchain, they can basically reverte anything if they agree. I assume Bitcoin wallet concentration is a consequence of the mining process and early adopters, not sure why aren't Reipple nodes more distributed or open for anyone to participate.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047895)

    @gerrymchugh --- *Eth are changing to concensus too, in fact they don't really seem to know what they're doing yet. BTC has most supply controlled by very small number of wallets, so while the validation is decentralised the supply is most definitely not.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047892)

    @CARXVV --- *Well, if you choose people that operate them, that is not very descentralized, anyone can mine bitcoin or Eth, I wonder why is it that way* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047891)

    @gerrymchugh --- *I dont know that for definite, maybe someone else here does but even if it is, they don't own/operate them... Still decentralised* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047888)

    @kokodjamba11 --- *Somewhere they want to ban cryptocurrency, why do it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047866)

    @Intervene_Herbal --- *They will never ban something that is taxable, think of the millions they tax people then you'll realize crypto won't go anywhere soon* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047890)

5. **judge, sec, clarity**

    @FTWASM --- *I need clarity on when the postponing stops and the judge start doing her work.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047572)

    @Ashish --- *Hello when is the final verdict on sec ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047488)

    @Russty007 --- *I bet the judge will retire after this case* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047748)

    @JustNNM --- *Think he just meant clarity from the SEC* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047571)

    @Jake_ripple_XRP --- *I trust the judge sees the duplicity of the SEC... and the weakness of their case... and rules accordingly...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047450)

    @Rektallstar --- *Yeah unfortunately that is the way it works here. The judge can get away with alot that may not seen fair to us.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047574)

    @marianmp --- *Just saying aliens are real .....doesn t mean you are right...you need to have something to back it up* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047679)

    @Ekkimukk10 --- *Not sure I agree with that dichotomy, there's a lot between great and hoax :) smart people rigging for themselves isn't neccessarily a hoax. It can still be wildly successful for everyone else.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047657)

    @Tinkabellagal --- *No conspiracies in here We add factual news* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3047505)
