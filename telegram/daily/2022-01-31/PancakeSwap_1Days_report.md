    @Ceddi200 --- *👩‍🏫 There are 2 common requests we see about CAKE.  1) Increase APR 2) Stop all Emissions  👏They👏cannot👏both👏happen.  ———  Q. Where does APR on farms and the CAKE-CAKE Syrup Pools come from? A. From CAKE emissions.   ⚠️If all CAKE emissions were cut to 0, APR would also drop to 0!  The CAKE you earn from the pools and farms are the CAKE that are emitted each block. Emmissions produce APR.  ———  So what are we doing about inflation?  📉We reduce emissions gradually, every month. We've already reduced from 40 to 14.5 CAKE /block.  🔥We burn CAKE every week + add burning mechanisms in new products.  The goal is, and always has been, for more CAKE to leave circulation than enters.  https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2311329)

9. **slippage, 49, mode**

    @Million --- *I get you Point ☝️ yes, question for support here, why slippage so high when doing swap here, how can I find the right opportunity to use it at lower rate? There is a link for a live chart where I can find the right hours to do swap at lower slippage? ATM 15% is not cool* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2311220)

    @Ceddi200 --- *Ask the team the amount of slippage you should use* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2311128)

    @vincenzo_btc --- *Alright so I got a question about expert mode. It says “allows high slippage trades” yet I still can’t enter more than 49.99%? Is it still going to use a higher slippage than 49.99 when making a swap?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2312121)

    @ninahaus --- *the description gives the impression that you can trade with higher slippage in expert mode, but the limit is same with non-expert mode. I’ll note this point to improve.  Regarding your question, 49.99% is max limit on UI. You can trade with higher slippage via BSCScan but I don’t recommend it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2312130)
