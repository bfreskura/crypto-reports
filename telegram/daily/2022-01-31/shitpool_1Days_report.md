    @MoneroPal --- *There is a 50/50 chance, unless you have proof to dispell the rumors, there is a 50% chance it’s true. It’s highly suspicious all of his transfers of USDT went to Bitfinex and not any other exchange. This is the same for Sifu…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721607)

    @tdotballing --- *Are people actually making tons of money on all these nft drops? I keep seeing on Instagram basically copy pastes of bored apes with different animals like bulls and goats and the channels claiming ppl bought them for like 800 and then sell for 300k. Is this actually happening or is it just like wash trading and the channels hyping them up* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721970)

    @MoneroPal --- *Wrong, US citizens must follow US laws wherever they are. In terms of a non-US citizen commiting a crime. If the US dollar is used in this crime or if the crime targeted and harmed US citizens, US prosecutors will go after this person or persons. You’re an absolute fucking retard…It’s honestly quite halarious how you think you have a clue, but you do not.
