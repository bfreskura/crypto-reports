2. **market, buyback, token**

    @joesumn --- *Was the listing on a new CEX a lie? The rumour been going round since November and is it legal to buy 1 million of your own DYP if you know it’s about to get listed on a new exchange? Doesn’t particularly add up* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243769)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Hey please read about impermanent loss concept in yield farming Also your deposit is 75% converted to LP and 25% to DYP so when you withdraw you get 75% of your the asset you selected and 25% will be DYP.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243630)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Hey iDYP is new token only few months of its launch and yes we have utility like farming, staking and Bridge for iDYP, moving forward there ill be more utilities for no Lending and Borrowing is confirmed which will come this year, more utilities will be available too, for launchpad DYP will be used* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243601)

    @hemanrock --- *DYP is native token of Defi yield Protocol. both are different tokens. both can be increased or decreased.  iDYP you can read more about it from here  https://dypfinance.medium.com/the-new-contracts-and-idyp-token-snapshot-airdrop-and-community-allocation-760a2be599c* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243682)

    @Barry --- *Hey y’all, got a question. What exactly is the utility of the iDYP token? Will it be used in launchpad? Seems like just a farming token with no real utility. Thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243600)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *We cannot control market fully, but if team feels it is needed just like how DYP is market bought may do the same for iDYP too, but iDYP is pretty new token so it needs some time, with more utilities coming it will have good movement, also in farming along with iDYP the other tokens like ETH/BNB/AVAX and also will be considered which are down too.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243745)

3. **rewards, claim, weth**

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *When you click claim and complete transaction you get rewards in WETH* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243788)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *That gets updated only if trigger happens, you can wait for someone in pool to trigger the claim then it shows up your rewards too* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243786)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Yes it shows 0 ETH because rewards are paid in WETH, once your claim transaction is success you get WETH in your wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243784)

    @DanielFraser --- *It says I can claim when hovering over the button but it shows zero ETH rewards to claim which I should have some over 2 days. I don't want to claim just now but wondering why I don't see any ETH to claim.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243783)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Hey rewards are allotted every 24H and for the rewards to showup someone or you should click claim  Claim is the trigger to show up rewards on dApp screen, on desktop you can hover on Rewards and see if it says feel free to execute then rewards are ready to be claimed, as ETH fees are high ppl generally claim once in a while and not daily* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243782)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *The WETH balance updates if someone from pool triggers claim, this is why you can choose to wait for rewards to show or if you want to claim rewards you can just go ahead and claim* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243795)
