    @B_sh999 --- *Don't agree. Solana main net is beta . Ddos attack could be occurred on all blockchains.  U mentioned finding node for attacking is easy in POH but even without  consideration  a solution  for this, due to increasing the amount of node validators attacking on all them is impossible . Just like what makes attack on Bitcoin  is very hard and costly* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325484)

5. **usdc, binance, usdt**

    @Nicolas_A --- *Hey Jonathan, Binance doesn't support direct withdrawals to Avalanche for USDT / USDT.e.  What you can do is withdraw USDT to another network such as BSC for Binance and then bridge it over to Avalanche with a bridge such as Celer Network or Synapse protocol* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/325690)
