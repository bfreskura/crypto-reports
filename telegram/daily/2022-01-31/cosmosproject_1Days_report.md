    @Ilpaliuz --- *So the advice when i want unbonding it's wrong: "Trying to switch validators? Use the ‘Redelegate’ feature to instantly stake your assets to another validator."* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483056)

    @AtomJazz --- *Yeah you can redelegate instantly but only once per 21 days.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483057)

    @AtomJazz --- *No need. As long as you're staked with another validator you're good* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483541)

    @LVpoker --- *Hi guys What’s the best wallet for staking to receive airdrops also?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483259)

    @Gnolang --- *Question jazz you think larger airdrops should be allocated to stakers that held their tokens longer or the amount you have staked before knowing a snapshot is coming?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483832)

    @Gj_ivan --- *I Heard we can take airdrops by staking ATOM... How It works?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483136)

    @TicoJohnny --- *Yes there seems to be an issue* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483109)

    @AtomJazz --- *Pls move Luna discussion to their own channel* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483799)

    @AtomJazz --- *Agree to disagree. For sure ATOM JUNO and OSMO are correlated but not LUNA. This will probably change in the future since now we have it on IBC too but historically speaking this has not been the case* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483783)

    @AtomJazz --- *No it wasn't. Luna was a main driver for Luna not for ATOM* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483781)

    @AtomJazz --- *Wut? Luna is an application specific cosmos chain that has nothing to do with cosmos hub and ATOM specifically* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483779)

10. **stake, atoms, vote**

    @Antoniomarrazzo --- *hi guys, what is the best way to stake atoms? i'm new but actually i have some atoms stacking in binance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483348)

    @pablo_flow --- *Ah OK, thanks so much ... i thought that the atom holder (in wallet, no stake) only could vote* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483653)

    @pablo_flow --- *Hi, ¿is it possible to vote in Cosmos Governance if all of my ATOMs are in Staking?. In other words ... ¿could i vote with ATOMs in Stake?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483648)

    @najmiddinov_nuriddin --- *How can I send ATOM from Binance?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483413)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *For nomic, you don’t need your Atoms at staked as far as I know. So I think you will be eligible for $Nom drop. Have you check Nomic website ? Join their telegram ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483915)

    @Sardon70 --- *Hi, I was thinking to put some Atom in stake but I have a couple of questions: 1) is inbounding period 21 days? In case is there a plan to reduce it and will it be changed from liquid staking? 2) do we get rewards during unbounding period?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/483427)
