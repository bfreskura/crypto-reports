6. **btc, market, cycle**

    @bake_Crypto --- *more dump in btc is expect* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054842)

    @Furkan --- *Let's not be too pessimistic.  With the Asian opening, the market moves a little.  Uncle Powell spooked the market.  However, investors have already priced in before these statements.  Support point works fine.  I believe we will easily see 145-174-224 levels.  With the opening of the US stock market, the down nasdaq direction is important for bitcoins.  I am an Ltc investor with spot and leverage.  good luck everybody* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2055176)

    @.. --- *Will btc pump next week ? (chinese new year)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2055082)

    @ForDaTek --- *Yup. While we preach ‘hodl’ the rich is cashing out the noob money that enters the market by dumping on them and actually buying real things and spending their profits. The other half just collects and trade to get more btc, never cashing out as they get older. Which is a good thing as they get older or suddenly die, their btc gets locked out of the market, great to increase price floors.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2054929)
