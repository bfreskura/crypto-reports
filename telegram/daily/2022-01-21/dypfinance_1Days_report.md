    @hemanrock --- *APY can be increased or decreased* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/241645)

    @Tryitontriton --- *Well now the APY is so high that the difference can be made up in only about 2 weeks of rewards, and then every day afterwards is exponentially better. So if the rebalance did this to the LP value, it seems to make up for it assuming that the Return Calculator is accurate* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/241571)
