    @Janevietani --- *Helpful tip:   if you want a cheaper alternative than bridging ftm and paying eth gas From binance(US) ,crypto.com or kucoin, get BNB and withdraw as BNB BEP20, then use https://spookyswap.finance/bridge To bridge BNB BEP20 to BNB Fantom Then use spookyswap to swap BNB Fantom to FTM  You will need ftm gas for transaction.
