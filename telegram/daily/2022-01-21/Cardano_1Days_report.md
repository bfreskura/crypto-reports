2. **nami, nami wallet, new wallet**

    @J --- *Pissed.  Yoroi wasn't gonna be ready for Dapp interaction so I made a Nami wallet and transferred.  Now I can't delegate to anything except their BERRY pool.  I tried changing on Pool.pm but transactions won't go through and I can't even move my funds out of Nami now.  Zero delegation when I was already set up to qualify for airdrops* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/772407)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *you still have time until 25th of January to delegate.  and you did not have to move your funds. you can delegate from Yoroi and you can restore the same wallet in Nami (or better in ccvault) to interact with the DApp.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/772410)

    @J --- *I moved my funds because I would not be able to interact with SundaeSwap using Yoroi since their Dapp interaction not released yet.  And created new wallet because it suggested interaction would be better.  Just didn't realize Nami would not let me change delegation in app* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/772423)
