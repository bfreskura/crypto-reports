    @K_arlso_n --- *LTC not have support. Dead coin.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050420)

    @archus --- *LTC is still pow and the functions of Omnilite are kinda limited compared to real Smart contracts, so why should actually people make use of it when also payments web3 providers are implementing tokens, of various layer1 chains that are way superior to LTC to use in terms of speed, transaction fees, validation time and stability   What also does actually speak for LTC to be used as coin to purchase when its more likely to be a dropping stable coin rather than using upcoming DeFi stablecoins?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049741)

    @lisalust --- *if LTC would Copy that Smart Move, then it can also be more Stable* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050248)

5. **99, richer, wealth**

    @RorschachTesst --- *Look at the demand for automobiles and electronics. Demand outpaced supply and not the other way around. You still think only 100M people increased their wealth?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050444)

    @RorschachTesst --- *Homeless people are not a gauge for the economy. While the pandemic has pushed more people below the poverty line, it has vastly increased the wealth divide compared to the 2008 recession. People in skilled jobs have become richer. The gdp has grown. More companies are entering the trillion $ mcap benchmark* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050424)

    @RorschachTesst --- *The top 10 did become richer but to claim nearly everyone became poorer is stupid. Why is there so much money in speculative assets if everyone is poor?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050436)

6. **mweb, release, omnilite**

    @Zer0fact0r --- *Tether just freeze 160m. Stablecoins are all centralized. Even dai to a certain degree if eth is the authority. Omnilite is just for tokenization. Smart contracts are limited on pow L1s, there are dozen of bridge to other networks to get smart contracts. We are not going to get native until some sidechain for btc arrive, it's just build differently than say eth, which has a ton of problem to solves being tuning complete.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2049846)

    @JohnTheApostle --- *Those who defend inflation keep saying "ye but deflation bad"* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050005)

9. **exactly, better, issue money**

    @Macro5674 --- *So we can all agree it's better than fiat, which is debt-based pyramid scheme where only cronies gets to climb above ranks , inflating our money by printing more constantly where our savings always devalued so that we always remain under pressure and keep people working ! And the fun fact is most of that printed money goes to corporates in loans which they don't even pay back mostly !* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050049)

    @RabbitL0v3r --- *Indirect democracy is in my opinion a failure* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050090)

    @Macro5674 --- *Something like Global Resource Based Economic system in which all goods and services are available without use of money ! Maybe but yeah by then (2045) something new economic system wud arise as everything is automated and run by robots and ai/algorithms but yeah cud be totalitarian or authoritarian in nature !* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050085)

    @Augusto --- *I pray that in 2045 that democracy be treated as the minimum necessary for a society and be adopted by all* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050069)

    @Macro5674 --- *So a world without money ! Hmmm it's a utopian dream which can become true too if we get totally automated in every sphere and thru AI eventually ! By 2045 maybe ! 🤔 my prediction as that's when we would roughly reach that stage according to any scientists too! But if not monetary system something else wud take place of it , fear that too ! Without money who wud control the world ? AI and robot operators!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2050058)
