    @finitemaz --- *I’d argue this is not class warfare. There’s no opposing groups socially or economically.

7. **exchanges, btc, end**

    @finitemaz --- *if one person dumped the entire btc price from $64k to $30k, and wanted to buy back immediately, the order book would be wiped and they'd be paying much more than $64k at the end of their order.  This is pointless to discuss in such a simple way.  If their goal is to extract value from panic sellers at the bottom so they end up with a net positive, then they will do that until it's not profitable.  The market works that way which is why most of you should not be trading.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2032013)

    @ck42069 --- *And how about those that claim “BTC has decoupled from the major indexes and the stock market”* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2031730)

    @finitemaz --- *do you agree there are a handful of exchanges that equate to something like 90% of the entire market trading volume?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2031950)

    @finitemaz --- *if you think they do that, do you continue to trade?  Do you claim the same manipulation when we pump 30% in a day? or is that organic* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2032069)

8. **coin, 50, 100**

    @RabbitL0v3r --- *You can accumulate both If you sell 1 coin for 100$, its now 50, you can or buy 2 coin, or 1.5coin and have 25$ left* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2032001)

    @finitemaz --- *sold 1 coin and dumped the order book by 50%, and assume you can buy multiple coins without pumping price back and beyond $100* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2032005)

    @RabbitL0v3r --- *Im such a bad trader and I lost my life saving ;3* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2032114)

    @finitemaz --- *I only entertained your comments because I actually thought I remembered you from years ago.  But now I see that you are either a troll or your logic and strategy when it comes to trading is much much worse than I thought. Or both.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Litecoin/2032095)
