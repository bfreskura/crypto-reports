    @t1324op --- *Hello,  I have a couple of questions about NEAR Wallet web app.  1. Why can't I just use a password to protect my wallet? All non-custodian wallets I know have password protection. Anyone who accesses the browser can withdraw all tokens if 2FA is disabled.  2. Why can't I forget/delete my wallet in the browser?  3. Why can't I use Google authenticator for 2FA?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/243419)
