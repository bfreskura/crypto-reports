    @dc_sky --- *Let me clarify.. I'm talking to the 20+ scammers that have called and DMd me in the last few minutes. I wasn't directing my comment to everyone else, assuming there are others on here who aren't scammers. That said, the only responses to my request for help have been super scammy, so if there are legitimate, helpful, and ethical folks on here I just haven't encountered them yet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314644)

    @Plato the Enlightener (👁,👁) --- *Every big coin channel is full of scammers try them!

    @Johnstonekina --- *You suspect it to be a rug pull?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314447)

    @Yoopez --- *Lyd team is pushing ruggers as Polarbear on EVRT and took their 200k cut on the IFO. Don’t care at all for the current rug cause they are slow ruggers as well. Just look how they manage : EVRT, Avao with inside trading & the strange TVL decreasing from 25M to 13M and dumped their lyd during the Maxi IFO. Avoid these slow ruggers* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314422)

    @Yoopez --- *The guy didn’t know how to do real options bro, it was a fucking joke. Just a cashgrab from lyd. These guys are doing IFO without any research on the team lmao. They just want their 200k$ cut* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314493)

    @metad3pt --- *right idk how much LYD had to do with  it aside frrom hosting his IFO, but  the polar bear dude is def a shit head and skammed all his investors.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314502)

    @Zaneflynt1 --- *"$SOL network claims to have a potential capacity of 50,000 TPS, though at present the Solana Beach dashboard shows much lower numbers." "The majority of transactions are voting "transactions".  "Overall, this means Solana shows 2000 TPS in their explorer, but 1680 TPS are consensus votes and not real transactions" "Only 300 TPS are real transactions." "Basically, $sol is artificially pumping their numbers."   Check rekt dot news "SPOTLIGHT ON SOLANA" for more.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314815)

    @ramziakram --- *since solana counting consensus vote a part of transaction unlike other chain whereby consensus vote not included and in Solana most of transaction are consensus vote* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314739)

    @vampyren --- *Plus SOL is centralized, i dont care the number they show as node, it takes a kick ass hardware + they take down and restart the network just like a kill switch...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314742)

    @ramziakram --- *for me,better if they support avax usdc version* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314398)

7. **usdc, trader joe, trader**

    @metad3pt --- *I think the issue right now is there is plenty of USDC.e because of the Avalanche bridge, and  that's not going to change. But until USDC is up on Curve, or someone with a lot of native USDC adds liquidity somewhere, AUSD, Pangolin, Embr, Curve, there's a shortage of "native"/circle issued usdc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314478)

    @ramziakram --- *in traderjoe got usdc.e and usdc pair. do not the pair still have high slippage due to low liquidity for now* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314954)
