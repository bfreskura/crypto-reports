1. **xrp, wallet, year**

    @marianmp --- *Can anyone remember how much it took for Xrp to reach from 10s of cents to almost 4 dollars ....??? I'm curios how agresive was the pump* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023554)

2. **settlement, ripple, sec**

    @erik_sz91 --- *What are you talking about? Brad Garlinghouse declared months ago they WON'T settle. They will win.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023350)

    @erik_sz91 --- *If the SEC is like ".... Ok.... Your evidence is great... Just gimme a couple of bucks and end this" (being a "couple of bucks" maybe 500k or so)  maybe they will settle. But ripple won't have a multi millonaire loss just for settle* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023375)

    @marianmp --- *Welll my question is....can we without wining the trial against SEC?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023558)

    @Zabourmouk --- *Well now, Ripple is a WEF Partner. https://t.me/Q_Anon8/22993* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023772)

    @erik_sz91 --- *Let me translate that into more easy language to see if I understand correctly. Settlement would be like Ripple saying "ok, this may be or not a security.... Take this money SEC, and don't bother me again"   and wining would be "Hey SEC, F*ck you, the judge said xrp is not a security, so I owe you nothing" and then xrp going to the moon* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023361)

    @Jake_ripple_XRP --- *SETTLEMENT.... If the Ripple/XRP vs. SEC case comes to a settlement, it could possibly cost Ripple a huge sum... maybe the requirement of divesting some of their XRP... but this would be fantastic for all parties... if at the end of the day XRP is considered a non-security and gains regulatory clarity from the SEC.... Is there another crypto out there that has regulatory clarity?...... Right.... So, big money and financial institutions will get into XRP unrestrained... This will be OUR DAY... and Ripple's remaining XRP stash will increase in value by billions!! Win, win, win... in every way.... IMO* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Ripple/3023502)
