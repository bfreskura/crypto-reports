    @fitzkie --- *Hai or Ceddi or Luuku..     I am still trying to set up a profile.  First step worked, got the NFT Collectible.  STEP 2 does NOT work.  Step 2 is Set Profile Picture.  Says to choose collectible, so I choose the NFT that I purchased.  the NFT loads, so not the issues.  The NFT Highlights and the enable button looks like it becomes clickable? (turns blue/green)   I then click enable and the button changes color, but nothing happens.  How to complete step 2?  I Have done this on a PC / Windows / Chrome Metamask. I used other browsers. I cleared the cacje.  I have done this with the Trust Wallet on IOS, got same issue, so then I deleted the Trust Wallet and installed SafePal on IOS, does the same thing. All get stuck at the same spot.   The only issue I can image is the fact that  I bought another non Profile NFT.   NO DM's please, i mean get a real job* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/PancakeSwap/2203151)
