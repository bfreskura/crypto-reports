    @DmgBautista --- *Its easy to check the real accounts, but always take as first approach the community guidelines! A moderator will have always the "moderator" tag here in the group, as surelly you see in my messages. This tag is centrally issued and no scammer have this. Also, they may copy the profile picture and name, but the telegram username that appears when you click in the name, will surelly be different. They may try to make it almost identical, but cannot be exactly equal. Just check carefully all the letters, and you'll se its a scammer.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/154355)

    @Willian --- *I just downloaded the defichain wallet, not sure if that is the so called light wallet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153904)

    @Willian --- *Is the light wallet easy to use?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153897)

    @Willian --- *What? So you mean i can't use the wallet connected on both desktop and phone?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153912)

    @DmgBautista --- *No, the database and code are different (one on jellyfish, the other not), so for the current time, they are independent wallets (as you can see, desktop wallet has wallet.dat file ans passphrase to recover your wallet), while the mobile wallet have 24 seed words for the same efect.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153913)

    @DmgBautista --- *Yes! Keep it please very much safe, as the mobile wallet and the desktop wallet are not compatible, your funds in one will not appear in the other, is a tottaly independent wallet. But in the future, there will be a light wallet for desktop (not a full node wallet as the current one)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153911)

    @DmgBautista --- *Yes, those product is not available for US users for regulatory reasons. If you realy want to provide LM to stocks, you will have to do it directly in the defichain light wallet, decentralized* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153896)

    @ChanA78 --- *Ah I see... hmm notice that the Total Rewards Earned figure isn't correct too. Its lower than what the Bar Chart says when I set it to All Time* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153983)

    @Willian --- *Today LM rewards are delayed again is there an issue with the Blockchain or something* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153888)

    @ChanA78 --- *loving the new website dashboard with the bar charts that show your rewards from the products you're using. Good job! However, in the top right column that says "Daily Cashflow" that figure seems to be off. It's too low, and doesn't gel with what's displayed in the bar chart when I set it to Today. Also, is the team looking into the low LM rewards?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153981)

    @ChanA78 --- *LM rewards today seems to be much lower than yesterday, but about 50%. Anyone else noticed this?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153934)
