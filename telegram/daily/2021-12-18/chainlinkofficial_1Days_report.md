    @FrankyD95 --- *Play to Earn game  Of course, our game Born Soldiers: Last hope is where players can earn our in-game token ShellZ ($SHZ).

The earned token can then be traded for in-game assets or FIAT currency.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355744)

A players Camp will be the base for all aspects of the Born Soldier: Last Hope game upon launch, including the Armoury, Mess Hall and game mode/map selection.  Also, the land can be used to breed new soldiers which can be HODLed, loaned for passive income or sold to new players.

4. **good, roadmap, future**

    @ByelowSeligh --- *Hi guys! When will vrf be online on avalanche?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355684)

    @Joypokkamol --- *There is no formal roadmap. The Whitepaper indicates future features (and some that are now live), this blogpost gives a good overview https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-2-0-lays-foundation-for-adoption-of-hybrid-smart-contracts/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355802)

    @JdBaas --- *What route is the game engine taking? In terms of Unity, or maybe something else?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355752)

    @Kxizizi --- *Web 3 appears to be a lot of fun. It's our future, after all, so now is a good moment to focus on it.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355724)

5. **vrf, attacks, player**

    @PolivodaTatiana --- *Thank you, Jack. More information about VRF can be found here: https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-vrf-on-chain-verifiable-randomness/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355765)

    @De_an_369 --- *Another area of the game where we will use VRF will be for the zombie attacks on Born Soldiers Camps (a player's virtual land). Players will have to invest in resources to build defences against random zombie attacks. VRF will help us to make sure that these attacks are fair and truly random for all landowners.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355764)

    @De_an_369 --- *For example, we plan on using Chainlink VRF to 'hide' weapon components and loot boxes throughout the game. This will mean that every time a player starts a new game or respawns in Born Soldiers: Last Hope these in-game items will be randomly distributed throughout the map.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355763)

    @marcromeron --- *VRF is on mainnet in Ethereum, BSC and Polygon.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355693)

    @nam_nguyenson --- *It's already is if I'm not mistaken. Many Avalanche-based projects are using Chainlink VRF already such as Penguin Arena Game or Heroes of NFT* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355688)
