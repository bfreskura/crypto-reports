    @Andr3w_1 --- *The migration is causing some glitches I think. A lot going on in the background that is causing some confusion all around* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/126628)

    @Liam --- *kk, so sounds like I will need to migrate eventually anyway* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/126395)

    @DD0820 --- *yea this migration doesn’t seem smooth* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/127195)

    @theMagicUnicorn --- *i personally dont really understand the confusion, it takes time to migrate, they are doing a drastic overhaul, and going as fast as they can, also the v2 migration is basically all set, you can migrate now.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125351)

    @Ap0l1o --- *You are, you are just not seeing them during the migration* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/126258)

    @Poopoo (never dm first) --- *migration only when improvement is needed, no one can tell you the answer, the external environment is always changing and new tech coming up, the protocol needs to respond to changes* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/127588)

5. **gas, gas fees, fees**

    @Poopoo (never dm first) --- *use https://etherscan.io/gastracker to check gas, do the migration when gas is low, someone has done it below $30* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125660)

    @Ninja --- *The apy is not the problem..the problem it is on eth chain...nobody wants to pay 300$ in gas* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/126541)

    @BROHMZ --- *Yeah but u can wait for when gas fees are lower there is no pressure to do it asap* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/126397)

    @Poopoo (never dm first) --- *gas issue, check your transaction gas and compare to live gas* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125962)

    @timon_k --- *Gas fees are low also now haha.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125967)

    @deadhead5116 --- *Idk this project is different people have massive bags in this that make gas fees negligible* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/126498)

6. **price, price gohm, gohm price**

    @lookmovie --- *yesterday as a test i bought: 0.402613 gOHM  7430 USD  at that time.  1 gOHM value at the time = $18,957.02  currently, my gOHM value is - 7126 USD  (304$ less since i bought) and current 1 gOHM price - 18,444.29 (500$ less since i bought)   1 gOHM price dropped at 2.7% but my gOHM value dropped at - 4.1%  1. how is this possible? 2. how can i see amount of rewards that were made since yesterday when i bought it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125480)

    @Michael --- *Yep, given the massive fall of value that is $40 too much. I don't want to wrap gOHM anyway - just want to keep sOHM as is (or have sOHM v2 whatever the state of affairs is)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125972)

    @MrMann89 --- *If price of Gohm matches price of ohm then at the minute if you want to utilise your money your best to unwrap it back to Sohm to benefit more as it’s better in price and vice versa if ohm was at a better price* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/127060)

    @darkmatta --- *Or wait… how tf is gOHM price calculated lol I’m clueless but I wanna buy some* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125420)

    @bvybitcoin --- *you dont, the index makes sure youre value goes up if the price of ohm stays the same or goed up too* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/127462)

    @MrMann89 --- *So once complete it will be the same price as Sohm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125548)

7. **discord, join, join discord**

    @Poopoo (never dm first) --- *weird, pretty sure it went up for me, should be the same for everyone, maybe join the Discord and ask there* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/126467)

    @FinnyBoi --- *Why OHM discord is so empty?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125604)

8. **rebase, rebases, rebase rewards**

    @GSG_AP --- *Question regarding rebase, is every rebasing happening every 8 hrs without delay?  If so, the rebase moments should always be at the same times of the day but it seems it changes everyday* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125190)
