    @iiLap --- *Why would it be? It is a full-node wallet, means it needs exactly the same spec/requirements as a full cardano-node needs. Even, behind the scene a full cardano-node is running.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/759920)

Which will give more Ada....if user stake thier Ada coins .. pool A or pool B..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/760074)

    @VMG --- *After the change of epoch the rewards are calculated. After the change of the next epoch the rewards for delegation are added to the rewards wallet of your wallet. It's not necessary to remove the rewards each time they are awarded, they are automatically delegated* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/760007)
