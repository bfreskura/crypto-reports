    @nate102 --- *Maybe an automatic honeypot check after idk 5 minutes after trades on a token have happened would be a good idea for this? There’s no reason a coin should be honeypot or have high 99% tax if trades have occurred on the token already* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313914)

    @jimmyvee --- *I was a member, and then there was a mini-scandal where they changed some rules about the group, and they said we were allowed to sell our 100K DEXT and still retain our allocations.  So, I'm in the position of not being able to communicate with the team, yet I am due my tokens. Do you have an email address or other way I can contact Frederic?:  He does not respond to DM's on TG. Thanks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313813)

    @jimmyvee --- *@stanes - I don't see any other way to contact you so I'm reaching out here.  I participated in the April 2021 raise for $BUMP Bumper Finance. @frederic will not respond to DM's on TG.  I am due my tokens from that deal.  Can you please let me know when we'll receive the tokens, and/or who I should contact regarding this matter.  Thanks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/313816)

4. **app, wallet, connect**

    @napascual --- *Mobile websockets are not the most stable connections on Trust wallet. They still need to improve a lot (even for Metamask). One trick is to wait on your trust wallet connect screen (instead of going back to the app) and wait until the app sends the Verification (sign) request to your app. For some reason, if you go back to the app the websocket sometimes stops sending data.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314306)

    @JoeyDieleman --- *You can but within the TrustWallet app on you mobile, so if you have the app on mobile in the Dapp browser of the app itself.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/314301)
