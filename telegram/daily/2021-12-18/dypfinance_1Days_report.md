    @kura1214 --- *Hi. I just want to make clear if I reinvest my DYPs on staking 90 days, did the counter reset or not?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230785)

    @sb3ee --- *I have a question guys.  If i added to my 3 day stake, does that reset the timer and i can no longer unstake anything , including earlier deposits, for another 3 Days?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230708)

    @captain_protein --- *Rookie question - do investments roll over automatically? Eg, if I invest in the 3 day Eth farm, does it roll over for another 3 day period after the initial 3 day period has expired?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230697)

    @chunshern90 --- *the lock time can change to "count by number of days"?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230701)

    @sb3ee --- *The initial deposit i deposited earlier, for example, i deposit 13 day one, and compounded or added the next day, technically - my deposit had been staked for 3 days.   Just doesn’t seem like logic.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230713)

    @Nefarpan --- *Lmao, that's too much to loose considering the ETH fees.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230775)

    @QTMiner --- *Is it recommended to put gas limit at 1200000? MetaMask is setting that as my default, I’m wonder if I’ve been seeing inflated tx costs due to that being too high* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230668)

    @hemanrock --- *When you click on wiithdraw, Please put it 600000 as Gas limit, It shows the Maximum amount to be charged but actual gas fees will be less that what is shown.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231015)

4. **farming, bsc, projects**

    @timdyp --- *It's just an experiment for the ''FUDDERS'' that all the time they are losing money, you know it's funny that we have at least 2500 people that are using the farming, staking, and buyback pools, BUT only a couple are losing money. So, I wanted to run this experiment and share my evolution of the 1 WETH invested in the farming pools. https://t.me/dypfinance/229910 https://t.me/dypfinance/229913* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230558)

    @timdyp --- *Honestly we don't like to call other projects competitors because everything that we have done was built from scratch, I mean all the smart contracts have been developed from 0, no forks, etc like 99% of similar projects are doing.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230604)

    @Nana_Y --- *Which chain is the most profitable in the long term for farming?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230467)

    @sb3ee --- *I’m not in staking pool.   I’m in avax   Farm.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230717)

    @shinigamikami --- *My farming experience with DYP has been an awesome ride so far, I’m farming on all three chains, the rewards are simply awesome and for those of who us who got in when idyp on BSC was $4.5 you can increase your share by topping up again, I did that yesterday cause I believe soon enough iDYP on bsc side will pick up, don’t worry that your deposit value is down on bsc farming it’s only temporal, same goes for staking/buyback side on bsc(use the opportunity to top up)👌* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231027)

    @notsodirty --- *Hi, are farms on bsc chain or eth chain?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230475)

    @ringLeader96 --- *My share is 0.15% of ETH pool, did not claim rewards* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230481)

    @Nubarv --- *So is it better to keep the rewards in pools or to withdraw it occasionally* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230590)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *The rewards you get depends on your share % of the pools* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230820)

    @WatermelonNoia --- *I have invested in them, but cannot get my rewards to match up based on the APY, TVL and my share %* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231101)

    @Craig --- *I just tried it. The unwanted address is not connected and the wanted one is. DYP is still connecting to the unwanted.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230977)

    @Craig --- *I switch in MM to a different address but DYP still connects me to the same one every time.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230975)

    @Craig --- *How do I change my wallet address when I open the protocol? It always connects me to the same address even when I disconnect DYP from my wallet, so I can never look at different address's.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230971)

10. **calculator, return, approx**

    @chunshern90 --- *the calculator stated (Approx. Value Not Considering Burns)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230825)

    @timdyp --- *The problem is that both the APY and RETURN CALCULATOR are showing the Approx. Value Not Considering Burns, it is impossible for us to know how many tokens are going to be sent to To be burnt / disbursed. But like I said the team is working right now on an update that will provide 99.99% real numbers based on the last rewards distribution.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230766)

    @chunshern90 --- *So the "Return calculator" is misleading?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230823)

    @chunshern90 --- *the approx values is so far different* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230827)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Hey consider the Burn% in the apy too, I beleive our devs worked on most accurate calculator and deployed yesterday, so you can use calculator on dApp to check the return values* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231103)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *No the return calculator shows Approx values considering Burn %, this was given clearly under calculator, we will have a updated calculator where it shows the results as accurate as possible* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/230824)
