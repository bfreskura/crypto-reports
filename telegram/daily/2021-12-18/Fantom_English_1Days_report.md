    @TaschaWolf --- *They don't have technical issues. Kucoin is having the same problem all the time too. Problem is lying with the team. When are they going to solve liquidity for mainnet tokens? It's been months and still the same thing. It's really tedious for someone wanting to buy ftm from cex to use in dapps etc.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/612857)

    @Janevietani --- *Helpful tip:   if you want a cheaper alternative than bridging ftm and paying eth gas From binance,crypto.com or kucoin, get BNB and withdraw as BNB BEP20, then use https://spookyswap.finance/bridge To bridge BNB BEP20 to BNB Fantom Then use spookyswap to swap BNB Fantom to FTM  You will need ftm gas for transaction. Use the faucet https://www.mentasuave01-tools.com/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Fantom_English/612630)
