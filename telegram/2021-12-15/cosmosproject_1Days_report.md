3. **confirmation**

    @Epikur --- *>>> If you have Android device, then you can try Keplr extension with Kiwi browser. But only thing doesn't work is delegating the coins. I am using it daily  >>> Nice! Wouldnt recommend it to new people tho hence there could be some compatibility issues and they would think that they are doing something wrong 🙂  >>> Yes, issues does exist.   1. You can't delegate to validator (it just doesn't show the tx confirmation modal)  2. Sometimes it opens extension tabs infinitely  3. .... maybe other  >>> Brave Android doesn't support extensions, just checked. Yandex does, but it doesn't work properly, Keplr extension UI messed up, unusable  ...  Just checked the Ungoogled Chrome with extensions, can't install the Keplr extension.

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Coingecko is correct one. We did ask to coinmarketcap many times about this uncorrect informations to change it but no answer yet from them. So You use should Coingecko one.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454139)

    @Kostas --- *I think shop marketing is bad..prices should be paid in atom and not in dollars in my opinion 😅* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/453996)

7. **cex validator**

    @yourdudeEv --- *Anyone know why the Smartnodes validator for ATOM is showing inactive?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454190)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *If your funds are on cex, you should move your atoms to Keplr Wallet and start to stake them there. Here is link and step by step guide;   https://t.co/eSyDVJMFAD?amp=1  And a step by step guide: https://medium.com/chainapsis/how-to-use-keplr-wallet-40afc80907f6* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454227)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *Hi there,I don’t know how to check past votes of validators. On Cosmoscan you can see their latest vote afaik. But you can easy check your votes on mintscan.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454105)

    @ZoltanAtom --- *For example cex validators are generally excluded from airdrops. The reason is for this cex validators are not contributing within Cosmos.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/453870)

    @Prometheus_Zeus --- *I think this comes into discussion once the fees on the hin will bet in total the inflation. Before it makes no sense because no one will stake anymore and validators will not receive their benefits.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/453358)

    @UnityChaos --- *Kinda surprised by how many medium sized validators failed to do the upgrade and are now getting jailed... probably not a bad idea for everyone to check if the validators they delegate to are actually paying attention and upgrading, cuz if they're not you're missing out on rewards* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454195)

8. **extension keplr**

    @ZoltanAtom --- *You should import your Luna address on Keplr.   (If someone dm to you, block and report it)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/453469)

    @Thanhdcb --- *is chihuahua run on juno or cosmos sdk?  so i see on keplr wallet, it looks like a coin* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/453850)

    @Ray_Louis --- *And I tried what you said . Can’t import my Luna address on my Keplr , says invalid address there . Seems like Keplr doesn’t support Luna network .* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/453515)

    @AtomJazz --- *In keplr select low fees instead of average. Maybe this will help. If that won't work you will probably need to ask someone to send you some dust LUM to have enough for the gas* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454007)

    @AtomJazz --- *Yesterday we had Chihuahua airdrop and Lum airdrop* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/453958)

    @UnityChaos --- *I don't really have one lol, haven't set up any public facing stuff for the validator, just been getting people who know me by reputation to delegate to it on various networks (Cosmos, Osmosis, Juno, Lum and Chihuahua atm)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454203)

    @Epikur --- *I am daily claiming reward from Bostrom network (not exist in Keplr Android and Cosmostation), so that functionality is enought for me. I didn't tested Osmosis and other dapps with that.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cosmosproject/454250)
