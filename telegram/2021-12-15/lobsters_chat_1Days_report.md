    @adammchen --- *Democracy is an issue in my humble opinion. When the elected officials are worried about the next term, what incentivizes them to think in terms of the countries long-term growth? ... nothing. However, in terms of pros and cons, it's still the best option globally to an extent.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/307249)

    @SpikeSpiege1 --- *Still unclear how he ever got onboarded as a project lead. Researcher doesn't usually equate to leader.  "That's so crypto." Maybe if there was a "shit posting thought leader" position.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/307098)

    @ChiTimesChi --- *On a more serious note, the solution is fairly simple.   1. Disable unlimited minting USDM backed by thin air. Hardcoded oracle has to go as well.  2. (Helloadminors will applaud this). Buy back minted assets and burn.  Why would anyone actually do this in unclear though.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/307602)
