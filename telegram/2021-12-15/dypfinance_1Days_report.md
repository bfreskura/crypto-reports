    @captain_protein --- *Sorry for the basic question - I have recently invested usdt.e in the Avax 30 day farm and have noticed that when I press "claim" the accumulated dyp rewards are sent to my wallet, but the accumulated and "claimable" wavax rewards are not. However, if I add more funds to the farm, the accumulated and "claimable" wavax rewards are then sent to my wallet as part of that process. Is this correct? Is there a way for me to claim the accumulated wavax rewards without depositing new funds?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/229503)
