1. **ltv**

    @defirlkp --- *there's no interest on a loan in orca, you have to pay a 0.75% fee when repaying a loan and if you ltv ratio falls below the threshold you can get liquidated and your collateral that you supplied used to repay the loan* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313160)

    @A --- *Thanks for your replies and patience.  ... ... ... I still don't get something.   Let's say you have some crypto (ETH, AVAX, BTC).   If you put it in AAVE, you can both earn interest and borrow against it. And you earn interest on the full amount of your deposit, even when you've taken out a loan so a large portion of your deposit is also collateral.  But with YieldYak or BenQi, you earn interest, but can't borrow against it. UPDATE: YOU CAN BOTH DEPOSIT AND BORROW AT BENQI. LOOKS LIKE YIELDYAK IS JUST FOR FARMING.  And at Orca, you can borrow against it, but you can't earn interest.  So it seems like it's better to keep as much as possible in one place where you can 1) earn interest on your full amount and 2) borrow and 3) maintain a safer LTV.   And it seems like if you split it up into two smaller amounts, by putting some in a place that pays interest but doesn't lend like YieldYak or BenQi, and some in a place where you can borrow but not earn interest like Orca, you've reduced the amount you earn interest on, and you've increased your LTV risk.   I'm probably missing something. That's why I'm here asking.  The reason it's so helpful to be able to turn to Telegram or Discord and ask questions is because it's a way to find out if your understanding is correct, or if you've come to wrong conclusions. It's hard to know if you understand something if you can't verify your understanding.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313165)

    @euroog --- *Might I suggest you jump into the Orca telegram and ask these questions? You can borrow to the limit of the LTV. If your borrow percent increase above the LTV because of decrease in price of your collateral you get partially liquidated. You can borrow as little as you want. The only restriction is that you can max borrow up to the percentage specified by the LTV, eg. 70%. Each vault states the LTV so you can see what you maximally can borrow.  YieldYak is the only platform whose interestbearing token receipts can be deposited into Orca. Here's a video on it, but they've added more vaults since it was published: https://youtu.be/zft6CenpjAU* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313477)

    @A --- *AVAX deposited to YieldYak to gather interest. Some AVAX deposited to Orca for a loan. Interest on loan paid by borrower to Orca. Interest on deposit paid by YieldYak to depositer.  1) Is that right? 2) Does YieldYak not lend using deposited AVAX as collateral? 3) If not (so you need to go to Orca for a loan), the interest you earn overall would be less, right? Because the amount earning interest is lower because some has been moved out of YieldYak to Orca?  4) I will look at Orca's documentation to see if I can find out if it's possible to know before borrowing from them what a stable interest-rate charge to the borrower would be at Orca, and will update this message if I do. If anybody knows off the top of their head, and for the benefit of others with the same question who might be reading this, I hope someone will reply. UPDATE: "there's no interest on a loan in orca, you have to pay a 0.75% fee when repaying a loan and if you ltv ratio falls below the threshold you can get liquidated and your collateral that you supplied used to repay the loan" 5)  A company called Nexo loans against crypto collateral for I think somewhere close to 7%, or 6.5%. Seems high. 6) Does anybody have a link to information about amounts of interest on deposits paid by YieldYak? 7) Does anybody know of a way to buy insurance on DAO deposits and borrows, so you might be covered in the event of something like a hack or demise of the team or ...I don't know what... ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313159)

    @defirlkp --- *in benqi you can earn interest when you supply an asset and you can also borrow, yieldyak is an autocompounder, with strategies for lending protocols such as aave and benqi (think its the usual folding strategy). in orca you borrow a stablecoin called avai which you can then swap for any asset you want and then use that to earn a return with whatever strategy you use, some go for stablecoin pairs/pools such as those at axial* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313166)

    @A --- *Thanks. Then is Orca simlar to Benqi and AAVE?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313140)

    @euroog --- *There's no interest, only the payback fee, as far as I understand. If you use AAVE or BenQi you GAIN interest on your asset, ie. it increase in value, and you can use that as collateral in Orca. So you can loan against it at zero interest in Orca, while the underlying asset has yield and increases in value* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313227)
