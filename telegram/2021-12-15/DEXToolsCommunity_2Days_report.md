    @tadnyarahul --- *Instead of $, will you deduct my DEXT coin per month or it will be always 1000 in quantity and I just need to hold it to continue with subscription?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/312898)

    @stanes --- *For the monthly subscription it's 100$ paid in DEXT. So today the price of DEXT is 0.5$ then you need to send 200 DEXT. If next month when you want to renew the price is 1$ then you will have to send 100 DEXT. For the holding, it's 1k DEXT whatever the price of DEXT is. And we don't deduct anything from anyone wallet.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/312901)
