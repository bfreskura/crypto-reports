3. **kcc network**

    @nam_nguyenson --- *If the sending and receiving network doesn't match, then yes most likely it's lost. Exchanges can sometimes help you with that so I recommend reaching out to them. There is not much we can help with here.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355152)

    @harrumphharrumph --- *Chainlink 2.0 is not really a "binary" transition, one day you switch off Chainlink and the next day you switch on Chainlink 2.0, but rather a set of capabilities that will develop independently to gradually make hybrid smart contracts go mainstream. Feeds using OCR or even smart contracts leveraging Chainlink Keepers are already "Chainlink 2.0" to some extent, as they leverage the hybrid nature of the oracle networks, given that they post information on-chain but part of the computation occurs off-chain.  More information can be found here and the linked whitepaper: https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-2-0-lays-foundation-for-adoption-of-hybrid-smart-contracts/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355018)

    @marcromeron --- *In just a few moments, we will have a Community Q&A with CRD Network who recently announced that has launched its official Chainlink node, bringing its compliance data on-chain to help facilitate institutional adoption of DeFi.

    @Jordan2994 --- *I'm from moonpot community. We are using Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) on BSC network in our protocol. Wanna know when can we expect Chainlink VRF on Fantom, because at some point we will go multichain and Fantom is our first target network.  would appriciate some leaks, just curious. Thank you on answer and time.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355033)

9. **discord technical**

    @harrumphharrumph --- *I think it may be down. The Kovan faucet said to email faucets@chain.link if there are issues. I sent a notice about 30 minutes ago to them. For things like this, though, you may want to join the technical discord https://chain.link/discord as that's where developers generally are.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355203)

    @harrumphharrumph --- *@RaeRae0 Sorry, the bot deletes messages from new users with the mention of dm's.   You can do that in the #keepers channel of the discord I posted just above your message. This is the best place.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/chainlinkofficial/355206)
