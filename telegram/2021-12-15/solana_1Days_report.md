    @C --- *Oh the FEDs meeting 2.0 at 21;00 CET will make btc bullish then a coll will intervene and bullish again.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/868934)

    @Ali_kurd_boy --- *Hello, was the Federal Reserve meeting held?    Does anyone know what happened?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/869333)

    @Ali_kurd_boy --- *To recap… The dollar was bought Sunday night, and all through Monday’s U.S. session, and then in the overnight markets it was bought some more, before turning around and ending the overnight session down... Dollar traders were all giddy about the FOMC meeting tomorrow, where they believe that Jerome Powell, will make some mention of a rate hike… Just the mention of a rate hike, will get these guys all giddy, like school girls, and I just have one question to ask them… How much of a rate hike do you see coming, if and when it does come? Gold AND Silver both gained yesterday, but is getting sold in the early morning trading today…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/solana/869068)

    @C --- *• The Fed will double the pace of the taper to $30 billion at its December meeting, which would roughly end the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by March, according to the CNBC Fed Survey.  • The central bank will then hike rates three times in each of the next two years, starting in June 2022, the survey respondents predict.
