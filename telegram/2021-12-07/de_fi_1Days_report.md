    @barty777 --- *With hundreds or even thousands of messages generated every day in multiple crypto TG groups, it's often hard to find relevant info among all the noise without spending a lot of  time reading through messages.  That's why we are developing a tool that can automatically summarize relevant information from any crypto related TG group, including this group. We generate daily free reports available here: https://github.com/bfreskura/crypto-reports  There is also a TG group where you can post suggestions, leave feedback, and get new updates: https://t.me/crypto_summaries* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/229861)

    @nvy0x --- *Hello everyone, Nic from DeFiSafety here. Firstly, thank you @dereksilva for allowing us to post in here, you’re awesome. Secondly, as you are all well aware, security (and lack thereof) is a major concern within the DeFi communities. This is why DeFiSafety has engineered a rating process that evaluates the safety of the most popular DeFi protocols based on their process quality and transparency. As this is accessible by anyone for free, we encourage you to use these tools as part of your DYOR. In addition, we would love to have discussions with you about the state of safety in DeFi. You can always @ me in here about certain topics or questions you may have, or head over to our website and join our various social media groups where we discuss these topics all day long. Also, feel free to post some review requests in our socials! Again, this is absolutely free. Thank you, and I hope you all have a great day. Stay safe out there!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/229822)
