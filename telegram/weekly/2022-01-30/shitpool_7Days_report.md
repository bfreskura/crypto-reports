    @da0man --- *future DEXes can require KYC-ed wallets* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/719854)

    @da0man --- *Most Americans have never been outside the US, and you expect them to go and open a bank account in some country that won’t report to the US — which is rare* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/719841)

    @MoneroPal --- *No country except the US can enforce compliance as US citizens are barred from banking worldwide due to FACTA. No other country has the authority or power to do anything about it. Almost all wealthy non-US citizens legally or illegally avoid taxes in their home country without reprocussion.

    @jjj1616 --- *from one perspective usdt should be a bit more us-legislationproof than usdc, but from the fundaments and the narrative about these coins, usdc and us based stable coins such as usdp are better and generally feel safer than offshore creations* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/720850)

    @yesbutalsono --- *yeah usd rn looks safer then usdc* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/720848)

    @da0man --- *this trash should do an insane bounce before death* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/719668)

9. **italian, bitfinex, laundering**

    @MoneroPal --- *There is a 50/50 chance, unless you have proof to dispell the rumors, there is a 50% chance it’s true. It’s highly suspicious all of his transfers of USDT went to Bitfinex and not any other exchange. This is the same for Sifu…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721607)

    @MoneroPal --- *Have you been living under a rock? Daniele is in person with this guy in Dubai. They collaborated on this project and dumped on investors from day 1. They did this by getting their 5% of free time as salary, per the whitepaper, wrapped it into wMEMO, then borrowed MIM against wMEMO on Abra, then dumped this into fiat via USDT. This was the “lick” the robbery, this allowed them to exit without moving price and maintaining that they too got liquidated when it did, but they received the token for free, the investors did not...  Daniele is linked to known Italian money launders, he has a company in Switzerland where the person was a director, the person was convicted and is serving prison time.   Sifu is a gigacriminal, the entire Wonderland, Abra, Popsicle team is non-doxxed outside of Dani and now Sifu, they’re all Bitfinex employees, 0xMerlin has been uncovered to be the CFO of Bitfinex* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721393)

    @michael_ssss --- *@Horselorde where do you fit in with all of the drama with TIME today? You mentioned you had some contacts on the inside. Are you in the Italian mafia?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/720700)

    @onchainjoe --- *suspicious for armchair investigators, finex is just an exchange and sesta probably kyc'ed there nothing criminal afaik* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721604)

    @MoneroPal --- *They wouldn’t be exposed to what is being done behind the scenes by the top level executives, founders, and hidden backers, potentially involved in criminal activity, gtfoh* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721603)

    @jjj1616 --- *it is possible that tether/bfxs might have connections to  italian mafia, imagine the business they run and that's interesting thing for criminal organisations to lauder funds. No evidence but just common sense* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/720868)
