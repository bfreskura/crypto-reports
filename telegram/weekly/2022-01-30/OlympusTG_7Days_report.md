2. **olympus, olympus pro, pro**

    @vipdent --- *I bought on Friday at $70  Totally newbie with Ohm and staking etc  ( I have some other cryptos but all in wallet ).   Very easy - once you have done it :-)  Transfer money to an exchange ( I use Binance but any big exchange will do).   Open a MetaMask account.  ( chrome extension or phone app).  Write down your 12 words.  ( do not share with anyone - ever).   In your exchange buy ETH with your currency.  Withdraw all the ETH to the address from MetaMask  ( the blue long address).   After 2-3 minutes the ETH appear in MetaMask.   Go to Olympus.finance  Click ( tap) enter app Then click wallet.  Then get on sushiswap or get on uniswap.  ( sushiswap didn’t work for me.  Transaction timed out 3 times.  So I used uniswap).   In uniswap, tap on connect wallet.   Go back to MetaMask.  It should ask you if you want to connect.  There is a small gas fee.  Click accept.  ( in my case nothing happened.  I had to close MetaMask.  Open it again - and then the window appeared)  Now uniswap ( or sushiswap) can see your wallet.  Select “from “ ETH.  It will show you your ETH balance.  Select “TO” ohm v2  Do not select MAX.  I did this mistake.  Leave £15 ( $20) for gas fees.  I had to transfer again.  I didn’t have enough for the bloody gas fees.   And convert to ohm v2.   Now import the token ohm.  Address of ohm can be found on their DOCs. Their website.   https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/contracts/tokens  You need ohm v2.  Somewhere in the middle.   Add this token in MetaMask.  Your balance will appear.  I also added sohm and gohm in MetaMask wallet.  All addresses from their website above.   Then go to Olympus.  Tap wallet.  Connect.  Go back to MetaMask to approve the connection.  ( in my case didn’t work again. Close MetaMask. Open it again.  The window appears.  Approve connection. )  Now you can stake.  Max.  I chose sOHM.   Again you need to approve it in MetaMask.  There are again gas fees :(  That’s it.   Good luck.   It took me 4-5 hours to do it.  I feel you.   If any issues, reply here.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/168905)

    @Keegan --- *If you work for Olympus you should care about my money!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/153056)

    @alfredojpontara --- *hallo, i want to withdraw all my olympus from olympus staking. i unstake gohm from staking and now i can see my ohm in te website olympus but not in my wallet. how can i switch my olympus from site to my wallet? thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/152097)

    @Derrick --- *Hello I am new to the group but wanted to share something that may help save on Gas fees. Not sure if many of you are aware but you can buy OHM on hotbit exchange with usdt for minimum trading fees, then send to metamask and stake on Olympus. This way you can avoid high swamping fees, and only have to pay the staking fee. Also since the market is down, its a great time to buy!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/160654)

    @D --- *I guess this experiment of Olympus really didnt result in the way I expected for me. They did say only invest what ur willing to loose and so I did. This was a well spent and well learnt lesson with DAO's for me. Good luck to u all and I genuinely wish you all the best with your financial crypto pursuits. Peace out, 1 love ✌* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/156995)

    @Mike_Wrekt --- *Why all daos are at - 70 to - 90% down? All scam?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/155498)

    @theseedoflife --- *How many ohm = 1 gohm?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/159019)

    @EdNgo --- *I wondered, if everyone buy gohm, who gets incentive to buy OHM?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/155027)

    @DIVIdoc --- *Calculator math for those in despair.  If you have 75 sOHM or gOhm equivalent now and we average 750% APY for the next 24 months your bag will be worth $500,000 usd if ohm is just $100.   Let’s quit talking about $1000 ohm (it was too premium).  Let’s focus on sustainability bc if we 3,3 and chill WGMI.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/160886)

    @RecoDedon --- *What's the difference to getting the gOHM instead?!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/169287)

    @Ap0l1o --- *You probably don’t have any sOhm, just your gOhm is shown as sOhm as well* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/152389)

    @Cixex --- *Let me clear my understandings. This is a very very long term investment. If you get lucky to have a whale pump the token, you would benefit. But if there is none, the model requires you to wait until your reward + token surpassed the initial investment cost. Do the math.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/161338)
