5. **account, zksync, vault**

    @xnatasx --- *@blckwd or @itamarl   So I sent funds to a friend's brand new argent wallet. Zksync to zksync. But then when she wants to use the received eth, wallet says it's $90 to active!  Should that still be the case? We are inside of zksync section. Have I missed something?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/245277)

    @xnatasx --- *Brand new installation. Never had account before. Not her. Not device.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/245288)

    @blckwd --- *Ok so maybe she accidentally found her way into the Vault account? She may just need to tap the account switcher top left and switch to zkSync* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/245283)

    @xnatasx --- *Sent a few dollars over to try. She never used a wallet before. But then when wanted to show, was asked to pay $90 to activate first...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/245282)

    @blckwd --- *It sounds like she has an older Argent wallet, i.e. created before about July 2021?   All new Argent wallets are zkSync by default. But if she has an older L1 Argent wallet, which we now refer to as “Vault”, then she needs to claim her zkSync account with her Vault, to ensure that the Vault is able to recover her zkSync account in future.  Unfortunately even though you’ve already sent the funds, she’ll need to also have funds in her L1 Vault to Claim the funds on L2.  If you have only sent a few dollars, you might want to scrap the account and create a new one, as that will be much cheaper to use.  New accounts are $3-4 to set up and $0.30 per transaction* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/245279)

    @xnatasx --- *My first onboarding attempt after update, so bit confused when saw high fee. Was sure it's not right.  But ok, if keep trying should to right place and not be that expensive...  Will do when back inside* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/245287)

    @Adneycal --- *Bet y'all not too familiar with Radix, isnt it?
