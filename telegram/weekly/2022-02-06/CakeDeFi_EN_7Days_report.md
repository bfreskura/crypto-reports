    @Michael_Schredl --- *Everything works fine for me, what error do you get?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167653)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *I don't think it is available in the app yet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/171492)

    @Sunny02 --- *I get this with Chrome, the Cake App (a red dot instead of the error message) and Safari* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169519)

    @JetFuelGenius --- *When I opened up the app earlier today, it told me it was out of date and needed to be updated. I was directed to the App Store, but no update was available. It is available now.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167805)

    @JetFuelGenius --- *When you release an update, it would be nice if you would make sure it’s live and actually available before blocking the old version.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167803)

    @Bald --- *Yes. Using Samsung. Downloaded the app from playstore. But was told the app was outdated. Problem is Playstore do not have any update* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167755)

2. **dusd, defichain, usdc**

    @Francesco --- *Thanks Kassius that’s the same answer I got from support but I still don’t understand how can I buy defichain DUSD. Do you have any clues on how to actually buy them? Thanks!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/172344)

    @DmgBautista --- *Yes DUSD has been dropping enough to offset the gain you felt in the DPDBC. DUSD has been trading already at almost 1,3$ usd aproximatelly, while currently is something around 1,1$ usd. It will drop further (my opinion only) once we get closer to the hardfork since many users are planning on exiting the pools, which will cause a drop in demand and further proximity to an actual 1$usd.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/168388)

    @mm_phoenix --- *you can swap directly to cake dfi in dusd, because you thought you could buy it cheaper somewhere, it became inconvenient. ☹️* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170208)

    @Aimun_J --- *Hi. I am trying to deposit DUSD into my cake wallet however the wallet address is flagged as invalid. Can I not transfer DUSD from my MetaMask in order to liquidity mine?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170190)

    @DmgBautista --- *Good morning guys! @zachgax it seems you had a rough night 😕   Unfortunatelly when users don't read the basics on safety and how to avoid scams, that are posted every single day several times a day, such can happen.  Sorry that you had to go through that.  All users, and once again, mods don't DM or call and there is no support on telegram. If someone sends you an unsolicited DM or call, whoever it may seem to be, just block and report. Plain simple as that.  Best regards! 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/172135)

9. **dfi, withdraw, withdraw dfi**

    @macsien --- *I looked my account but I can't withdraw because it's zero dfi.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170423)

    @Malii007 --- *yes I used DFI chain. I had withdraw before, it took a very short time. Now I'm surprised it took so long.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/171255)

    @Malii007 --- *I submitted a DFI withdrawal request.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/171241)

    @DmgBautista --- *What do you mean no direct transfer or withdrawal? That is literally the most basic function on the platform and works fine.  Just send your DFI through the defichain network to a supported exchange (kukoin, bittrex, hotbit, bitrue, and many others) and cash out if you wish so.  If you are speaking of frozen coins given as welcome bonus, those you cannot withdraw before the 180 freezer days elapse, in order to give you time to understand the platform and not attract users that are only after free money.  Best regards! 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169260)

    @n01r77 --- *Hi, is this learn and earn 5$ Dfi is withdrawal or not?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/167516)

10. **apy, apr, eth**

    @Manvydasm --- *Ok, but current apy is shown 0%* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/168381)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *!APY rewards are shown in APY, Not APR. Check out the link to learn more about it :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170502)

    @默默啃书小凳子~ --- *hmm, to answer this question must know about apr and apy. According to investopedia,  APR represents the annual rate charged for earning or borrowing money. · APY takes into account compounding, but APR does not. Same number of APR and APY get different outcome. So, direct compound to LM will get more compare to staking. Remember higher return higher risk* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169763)

    @YyeapY --- *yeah i know apr apy....if i compound it on LM i will reach apr faster, just wondering which strategy is under middle risk* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169764)

    @Cammy2904 --- *Lol 😂 you know what a normal bank account gives you? 0.01% APY. YES you read that right. So everything from 40% and up APR is just heaven* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/168473)

    @xavier_pwm --- *Hi everyone, would like to ask how do the rewards are determined backend. It seems that the estimated APY and actual reward payout is different by about 30%. In my case, I did a 10 year freezing, hoping to get the indicated 90+% apy return, only to be receiving about 30% less. Any advice?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/169438)

11. **freezer, entry, freezer entry**

    @fadfunky --- *All my freezer is 10 years freeze.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/172783)

    @Erkan --- *Ohh, i didn't know it, Yes, they are frozen* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/171738)

    @zachgax --- *Yes, but evening you no longer have any normal freezer right? All your freezer is now 10 years. So you won’t see normal freezer anymore. 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/172804)

    @fabioandreatta --- *Check your freezer page for defrost day. 180 days* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/170305)

    @Javixo --- *I know scammers are not here; just warning people 😊* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/171983)
