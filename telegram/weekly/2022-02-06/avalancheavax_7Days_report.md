The thing that the community loves the most is the access to exclusive private sales. If you hold 25,000 FRM/.3. FRMx you get a guaranteed allocation into all projects that we launch. Some of these projects have performed incredibly well ( e.g. we have had 3 100x+ projects and many other very successful ones). Plus. our system is stress free (not first come first serve) and we bring out new deals almost every week. For more info check out our pre sale page: https://ferrum.network/presales/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/326407)

    @ifriend05 --- *The next major product release is The Crucible - a next generation DeFi staking product that allows you to earn sustainable APY, access our pre sales, and will burn FRM with each transaction. Its a revolutionary new DeFi product that essentially turns any token into a reflection token and from there, we can add all sorts of custom features. Its going to revolutionize the way our users interact with our ecosystem. After Crucible, the focus is on the Ferrum Network main net, which is built on top of the Polkadot/Kusama technology. We are releasing more information about our interoperability main net in the coming months ahead and it is slated for launch in 2022.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/326789)
