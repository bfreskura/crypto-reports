10. **apy, pool, days**

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *No we cannot APY depends on number of ppl participating in the pool, though lesser days have higher APY the rewards you earn will be more in bigger days* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243751)

    @iamJubi --- *APY change depends on TVL, prices of token involved on the pool, etc.   "To Be Burnt/disbursed" iDYP on the pool is yet to be distributed as reward or burnt, so it contributes to the APY. If you check, 60 days pool have no more iDYP that is potentially be disbursed while 90 days still have. This is another factor.  Also, higher lock time have higher allocated iDYP reward daily. let me check with the team  for some other factors that affects the APY. But as said, originally the longer lock days the higher the APY was.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/242860)

    @Janes --- *How are yield curves determined in the different v2 farms across the various lock times? It seems odd that there is a mid point on some of the farms where the 30 day pools are actually yielding a lot more than the 60 day and 90 day pools. How dynamic are these yields day to day? Seems like there should be a better way of compensating those that chose a longer lock time.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/242849)

    @Barry --- *Can you guys raise APY in the 30 day pool as opposed to 3 day?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243749)

    @unalpotur --- *Farm v2  no lock apy %122 30 lock apy %107 90 lock apy %175 Why?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/243406)

    @Janes --- *Thanks, so the yields are Purely TVL driven or is there also an underlying mechanism that also rewards more for a longer lock time? If it’s purely TVL driven, then why would there be a reason to have pools of different lock durations?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/242853)
