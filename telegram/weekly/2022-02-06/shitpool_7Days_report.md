5. **italian, investigative, director**

    @MoneroPal --- *There is a 50/50 chance, unless you have proof to dispell the rumors, there is a 50% chance it’s true. It’s highly suspicious all of his transfers of USDT went to Bitfinex and not any other exchange. This is the same for Sifu…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721607)

    @MoneroPal --- *Have you been living under a rock? Daniele is in person with this guy in Dubai. They collaborated on this project and dumped on investors from day 1. They did this by getting their 5% of free time as salary, per the whitepaper, wrapped it into wMEMO, then borrowed MIM against wMEMO on Abra, then dumped this into fiat via USDT. This was the “lick” the robbery, this allowed them to exit without moving price and maintaining that they too got liquidated when it did, but they received the token for free, the investors did not...  Daniele is linked to known Italian money launders, he has a company in Switzerland where the person was a director, the person was convicted and is serving prison time.   Sifu is a gigacriminal, the entire Wonderland, Abra, Popsicle team is non-doxxed outside of Dani and now Sifu, they’re all Bitfinex employees, 0xMerlin has been uncovered to be the CFO of Bitfinex* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721393)

    @michael_ssss --- *@Horselorde where do you fit in with all of the drama with TIME today? You mentioned you had some contacts on the inside. Are you in the Italian mafia?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/720700)

    @ptsolorid --- *Lol at zachbct or whatever being an actual investigative journalist. Hes a spreadsheet warrior* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721828)

    @MoneroPal --- *And it’s an actual real investigative journalist* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721802)

    @MoneroPal --- *They wouldn’t be exposed to what is being done behind the scenes by the top level executives, founders, and hidden backers, potentially involved in criminal activity, gtfoh* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721603)

6. **spell, mim, wmemo**

    @MoneroPal --- *not really, they dumped a shit load of MIM and SPELL, they will likely milk it for whatever its worth until it all collapses* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/722422)

    @MoneroPal --- *MIM is minimal in defi, it is primarily being used to loop through Dani’s bullshit projects, TIME, ICE, and so on, doubt it will cause a huge ripple if it tanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/720640)

    @Alwayscooked --- *Lol if spell makes a comeback* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721365)

    @onchainjoe --- *SPELL was essentially bribing to keep UST liquidity pegged* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721411)

    @MoneroPal --- *The whole industry is obsessed it’s mentioned on every financial publicaton worldwide including Bloomberg. It is over though and the treasury doesn’t mean shit. They’re offering a $3x,000 buyback for wMEMO. The founders and insiders made off with hundreds of millions directly and indirectly. It’s satisfying seeing the frogs get fucked and still support the clown...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721964)

    @ptsolorid --- *I believe that spell and Mim will come back if no funds are stolen* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/721385)

    @MoneroPal --- *Im about to ape into ETH here fellas, wish me luck, or stop me* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/723157)

    @MoneroPal --- *It is highly unlikely ETH will be dethroned anytime soon it just hasn’t happaned. Nothing of importance has been built on AVAX, FTM, Polygon, SOL, or any of the new L1’s. Literally all dog shit projects, rugs, or VC exit scams. ETH is still king, yes it sucks, yes it’s slow, but it’s king.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/722496)
