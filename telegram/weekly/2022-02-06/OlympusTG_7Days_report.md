    @vipdent --- *I bought on Friday at $70  Totally newbie with Ohm and staking etc  ( I have some other cryptos but all in wallet ).   Very easy - once you have done it :-)  Transfer money to an exchange ( I use Binance but any big exchange will do).   Open a MetaMask account.  ( chrome extension or phone app).  Write down your 12 words.  ( do not share with anyone - ever).   In your exchange buy ETH with your currency.  Withdraw all the ETH to the address from MetaMask  ( the blue long address).   After 2-3 minutes the ETH appear in MetaMask.   Go to Olympus.finance  Click ( tap) enter app Then click wallet.  Then get on sushiswap or get on uniswap.  ( sushiswap didn’t work for me.  Transaction timed out 3 times.  So I used uniswap).   In uniswap, tap on connect wallet.   Go back to MetaMask.  It should ask you if you want to connect.  There is a small gas fee.  Click accept.  ( in my case nothing happened.  I had to close MetaMask.  Open it again - and then the window appeared)  Now uniswap ( or sushiswap) can see your wallet.  Select “from “ ETH.  It will show you your ETH balance.  Select “TO” ohm v2  Do not select MAX.  I did this mistake.  Leave £15 ( $20) for gas fees.  I had to transfer again.  I didn’t have enough for the bloody gas fees.   And convert to ohm v2.   Now import the token ohm.  Address of ohm can be found on their DOCs. Their website.   https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/contracts/tokens  You need ohm v2.  Somewhere in the middle.   Add this token in MetaMask.  Your balance will appear.  I also added sohm and gohm in MetaMask wallet.  All addresses from their website above.   Then go to Olympus.  Tap wallet.  Connect.  Go back to MetaMask to approve the connection.  ( in my case didn’t work again. Close MetaMask. Open it again.  The window appears.  Approve connection. )  Now you can stake.  Max.  I chose sOHM.   Again you need to approve it in MetaMask.  There are again gas fees :(  That’s it.   Good luck.   It took me 4-5 hours to do it.  I feel you.   If any issues, reply here.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/168905)

    @Anselmo007 --- *If not the apy what is the reason for invest in olympus?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/177402)

    @theMagicUnicorn --- *Olympus PRO was introduced to the world on September 17, 2021. The idea was simple: allow DAOs and projects to take control of their token emissions and liquidity mining programs through protocol-owned liquidity. Since our launch in late September, we have been full steam ahead and have onboarded 40 partners across four different blockchains and layer 2s including Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom, and Arbitrum. In total, we’ve helped projects bond >$45,000,000 in liquidity and have produced >$2,000,000 in revenue for the OlympusDAO treasury — all in just 4 months’ time   https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-pro-in-2022-c21c4fedb2cc   https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/179154)

6. **gohm ohm, gohm, price ohm**

    @Palancapa --- *so it is true that anyone who is looking to invest into OHM should actually buy the gOHM on a different network, in order to save gas fees* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/176975)

    @abdulrao --- *earlier i converted OHM tosOHM, so what i need to do know* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/171088)

    @Palancapa --- *But i dont understand why 1 gOhm continues to gain/include more ohm over time* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/173211)

    @huangkaoya --- *So holding ohm is not the best choice for appreciation, holding gohm is ~* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/180604)

    @Max --- *I still don't get where I'll make money from if it is not by increasing my amount of OHMs (or in gOHM terms, by the increase of the index)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/179725)

8. **bonds, bond, inverse**

    @Mine --- *OlympusDAO - OIP-76: Create Inverse Bond Policy Lever https://snapshot.org/#/olympusdao.eth/proposal/0xa544837835f3c4e681efba18d33623d4eb2acedec352dfc3c926a45902cd3612* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167863)

    @nfwaple --- *Ohmies, the Policy team is proposing to add inverse bonds to the toolbox of levers. Created only in conditions where OHM is market trading below backing, inverse bonds let users bond OHM into the treasury, and in exchange they receive some asset back. Inverse bonds use the same pricing mechanism as standard bonds.  In conjunction with standard bonds, inverse bonds allow the treasury to maintain strong backing under any market condition.  Read more on the forum (link below), provide your feedback, and vote. If the informal vote passes, it will go to snapshot.  https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1020-oip-76-create-inverse-bond-policy-lever* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167827)

    @Winter_Chemistry --- *There is new policy posted. The team can have inverse bonds being introduced in case it falls below backing price.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/167243)

    @Host_Matt --- *neba if people dont get a discount for bonding why would people bond when they can buy ohm and stake* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/180704)

    @Neba --- *Correct, the call hear is not to eliminate bonding but to discourage it when price is falling.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/180719)

    @nfwaple --- *inverse bonding should only be triggered when price is below backing* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/178938)

9. **scammers, scam, scammer**

    @chitangxxx --- *Yeah it is. Go there and tell people to chat here!
