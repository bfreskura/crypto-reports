    @scemodonore --- *Don't get too excited over buybacks for now... they won't have much impact on pa. The whole fan token sale was more a showcase for the power of ampnet software for me... If they build on this progress we may see some more speculation driven pa in the near future I think.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36966)

And then conversely what happens if it does fulfill the total amount? Thanks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36856)

    @North --- *@jakovtradingmentor what do you think about timing of any shilling to Chiliz community? They obviously have aligned interests and so would probably be interested here too, but we should take care to not get ahead of ourselves* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36775)

    @jakovtradingmentor --- *could you elaborate by what you mean with shilling to chilliz community?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36776)

5. **haven, bar, time**

    @Tinus_Tussengas_1984 --- *thanks m8. that loading bar is looking strange btw... i assume its to see the progress in time to the deadline instead of the percentage of funding 😋* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36806)

    @runex_x1 --- *there is clearly something wrong with the progress bar (brave)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36882)
