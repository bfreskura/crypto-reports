    @The Dude --- *Please confirm transaction in Algorand wallet and nothing happens* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/337131)

    @rikaponti --- *good morning. I've been trying to get some $ YLDY back for more than 1 month and I don't know where to turn. I tried with the assistance of the myalgo platform, but they don't seem to understand what the problem is. I try to explain myself. On December 24, 2021, I sent $ YLDYs from my Algoran wallet to the MEXC exchange by selecting the "close account" function to reset the balance. My mistake was to have indicated the amount of $ YLDY where instead I should have indicated the destination address. In theory, the transaction shouldn't have happened. At this moment there are none in my wallet and neither are in the recipient's exchange. How can I get my $ YLDY back?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/336112)
