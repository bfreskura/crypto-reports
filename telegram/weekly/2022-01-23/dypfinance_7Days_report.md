    @Paulus --- *How can i check the APY for DYP in farming?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/239687)

    @iamJubi --- *Decrease of the price of tokens involved on the pool, the more users deposit the lesser the APY.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/242151)

    @Tryitontriton --- *Well now the APY is so high that the difference can be made up in only about 2 weeks of rewards, and then every day afterwards is exponentially better. So if the rebalance did this to the LP value, it seems to make up for it assuming that the Return Calculator is accurate* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/241571)

    @Twittsbets --- *I notice even the Gwei is below 100 it doesn't correlate to claiming the DYP token in ETH.  We all know its not in your hand about the gas but it has something you have the control to check why is it getting high gas all the time.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/240010)
