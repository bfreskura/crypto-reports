1. **staking, rewards, apy**

    @iamaturtle123 --- *Hi guys, programmer here new to the Blockchain. I am thinking of creating a tax preparation app for yieldly where I put in an address and it spits out a list of interactions with the yieldly staking app along with the price of yieldly on the day of the transaction. My question is how should I query the blockchain? It looks like the algo explorer api would do what I want, but I also see that is deprecated and frowned upon. Would I have to run my own algo node to do this, or is there another api I should use?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332161)

    @abovyanv --- *isn't it weird for you that someone made some decisions for you and giving to you options A and B for voting. And this is freedom and Decentralization?

    @TheRealGiulio --- *Fully agree. USDCa and USDta on big exchanges would be huge!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332977)

    @S --- *I’m not trying to find it for myself, My point is that I hope it’s a priority for the foundation to get USDCa listed on the top tier exchanges. That would be worth more than any marketing deal they could make for expanding exposure to the ecosystem.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332954)

    @S --- *Going to try asking again… Is the foundation working on getting USDCa and USDCt added to the major exchanges? Coinbase, Binance, etc? If so, what does this process look like? Is it up to the Algorand foundation to pay a listing fee and facilitate building it the infrastructure? Are Coinbase and there like deliberately disallowing USDCa on their platform due to their partnership with Ethereum products? It would be great to know why tors hasn’t happened yet…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332944)

    @S --- *Do you know what that process looks like and a possible timeline? Is it simply a matter of paying a fee to the exchange and helping them build out the infrastructure or does it require convincing the exchange to make the listing?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/algorand/332793)
