1. **cardano, native, network**

    @missmaster81 --- *Hi everyone! Noob here to staking cardano.  Can someone help me understand the shelly era wallet?   I was given some instructions to join a staking pool that indicated creating one.  However, I had already created a new wallet and transferred my ada in.  not sure if i need to transfer from my wallet to this shelly era wallet before delegating??? hope this doesn't sound like a stupid question.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/772890)

    @GioLoop --- *Cardano is increasingly green and ready for recovery https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2022/01/12/cardano-green-ready-to-restart/?utm_source=CryptoMarketCap&utm_medium=app* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/768381)

    @invivekworld --- *Thanks, can we stake cardano or its better to stake at binance?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/767946)

    @MrBrinker --- *Bep20 is not ADA the native currency of Cardano blockchain, it is a token o  Binance Chain. If you want to stake or use any other native Cardano Dapp you need to have native ADA* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/770262)

    @matt_artano --- *I would argue it's pretty relevant if we're talking about permissionless and decentralization. We have a branch of Cardano essentially curating reddit in the direction they like, whether it's stiftung, emurgo or whoever, they're still tied to Cardano.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/767340)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *I hope they will have a good launch, it will be good for Cardano.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/772102)

    @yefrou73 --- *I want that, but first I have to getinto my daedalus wallet🙃* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771738)

    @Angeri8 --- *Question on wallet: I tried to install Daedalus but by pc has some restrictions so I cannot do it.   I've read about Yoroi on Cardano page and It seems they say "you better don't".. so I'm a bit scared* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/770756)

    @The Watcher --- *Hello everybody, can i hodl Coti on Daedalus?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771781)

    @Agilmore77 --- *Can we still earn the sundaeswap rewards for staking to their iso scoopers?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/773414)

    @Sailesh --- *hi is it too late to changes taking  pools to get Sundae tokens?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771806)

    @TheC --- *To acquire Sundae through ISO participation, can we delegate ADA on Daedalus?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/769846)

    @mostudio --- *If you stake using one of the Ada wallets mentioned and add your ada to an official sundaeswap scooper pool, you will also receive sundae tokens.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/767986)

    @HenryFarq --- *With this sundaeswap iso, there is no allocation published showing how much you would get if you delegated your Ada to the scoopers. You might get a lot or little.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/770184)

5. **nami, nami wallet, wallet**

    @Agarta --- *DO NOT USE NAMI WALLET!! It’s not allowing people to withdraw their ADA. The wallet might be stealing your ADA!!   Share so we can stop them. And try your self so you know that am not lying. Ur Ada is really stuck!!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/773536)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *you still have time until 25th of January to delegate.  and you did not have to move your funds. you can delegate from Yoroi and you can restore the same wallet in Nami (or better in ccvault) to interact with the DApp.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/772410)

    @Niro01 --- *Hello, I have sent some ADA from nami wallet to another account within the same wallet. I got the green banner sayng transaction submitted but it does not show up on cardano scan.It has been more than 15 hours. Will it go through eventually? Or I need to send my ADA again?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/773817)

    @mihhai0 --- *but it's sad that nami wallet doesn't have a support part, and i have tried severl times to send my money into another wallet but did not succed and they succeded so easely* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/773779)

    @apex_pool_spo --- *you did not need to move funds. you can use multiple "Wallets" like Yoroi, Daedalus, Nami, ccvault, typhoon, Flint, Gerowallet in the same to access your wallet, just like you access a website with multiple browsers.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/772424)

    @ExInfernis --- *In nami wallet is stated that it is prefered to create new wallet and transfer to it* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/773121)

6. **epoch, snapshot, epochs**

    @apex_pool_spo --- *when you delegate to another stake pool, the current epoch and the next epoch you still delegate to the old stake pool, the epoch after that you delegate to the new stake pool.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771554)

    @glitch04 --- *you have until the 25th so no if you move before the epoch, any further help you will need to ask in their support channel* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771809)

    @frenske1 --- *Not just talking about the epoch Transition time tho, unfortunately.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/769452)

    @Michael --- *If your wallet is already staked and earning rewards, then yes, the next epoch* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/773975)

    @glitch04 --- *You just have to have the funds staked before the snapshot window each epoch* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/773430)

    @missmaster81 --- *Thanks for being responsive!  Got it.  when i noticed the claim/transfer tab had the whole shelly/byron thing, i became confused.  OK!  Great. Going to delegate.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/772904)

    @peeved82 --- *There is no acknowledgement of switching Delegators, and no error message.  Just me pushing the Delegate button and getting no response .* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/772301)

    @peeved82 --- *Still not able to delegate to another stake pool than OccamFi . I go through the process of delegating to another stake pool but I cannot seem to leave OccamFi.  Is the Occamfi pool special and has additional process’s to follow? When I check Cardanoscan I am still Delegated to Occamfi pool.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771553)

    @peeved82 --- *The only Delegation History is from 3 months ago where I staked to Occamfi.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771930)

    @LionelG1995 --- *Awesome cheers, and are there disadvantages for a lower pool saturation %* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771877)

    @DrNo8910 --- *Lower pool sat % pools has a less likely chance to get a block. But this is a simple explanation of it. It gets complicated.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/771878)

    @atc1235 --- *Guys are you worried about sundaeswap's launch?  I'm a bit worried because they said some hogging is expected, but the vast majority of the people isn't aware of that, and i think this will cause a lot of FUD. Thoughts?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/772258)

    @JonSmith007 --- *I expect a better business decision. If this was a known result then the owner of the project is a clown. Why not launch in 6-8 months rather than create a load of FUD on your project* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/773860)
