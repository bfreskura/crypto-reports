2. **wallet, token, swap**

    @Benjamin --- *Synthetix has its own blockchain, but it operates on top of an underlying blockchain to provide a high-performance extension of the base blockchain, but since Synthetix is layer 2 Scaling Solution on top of Ethereum, it doesn't require Token Swap. it will remain ERC20 Token.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18556)

4. **lot, 30, appreciate**

    @Crypto --- *Thank you Chi Liun, and thank you for the /up vote! I appreciate those a lot. Synthetix is one of my greatest passions and I'm honored to help educate fellow community members!  And whoever else replied to my comment with /up I appreciate it.  I've been saying for a long time, top 30 is within reach very soon, maybe even top 10 in next 12 months.  Some may say this is conservative, some may say not aggresive enough target. Will not please everyone, but this is just my thought process.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18726)

5. **binance, staking, believe**

    @Crypto --- *Launchpad, trading contests, tons of community campaigns like AMAs, defended Synthetix about the recent crash, and at every step of the way has shown they support Synthetix strongly. They will DEFINITELY host staking for Synthetix. I am 99% sure of this.   I hope these insights help everyone to understand why I, and my company LDA strongly back and believe in Matic as the main marketshare holder for Ethereum which I believe will beat out all of the other platforms for dapps, games, DeFi, and other blockchain protocols.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18724)

    @Jose --- *Will staking be on Binance ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18716)

    @Cheng --- *Admin Do you think there will be Binance staking....im unsure whether to leave the tokens on the exchange or the wallet. Is that something you can answer* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18642)

    @Benjamin --- *There's no details yet regarding binance supporting Synthetix staking. If there's any update, we'll announce it to the community.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18718)

    @Benjamin --- *Also connect the dots please. Synthetix is doing so well, i hardly believe binance wouldnt support staking.  I can not believe people are struggling with Synthetix (not particularly you)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18649)

6. **staking, rewards, cheap**

    @Mulyana --- *During staking, so I do not need to hurry right? First come first serving not* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18791)

    @Ahmed --- *Any staking reward calculator available already? Or its fixed percentage?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18611)

    @Oscar --- *I want to ask how much will be maximum reward if i stake 4000 or more thousands token* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18613)

    @Daniels --- *Honestly buying from this cheap price is amazing 😂 just enjoy it staking will push things up abit too for sure* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18800)

    @Benjamin --- *No, rewards for everyone are the same, it depends on the total amount staked at any one time So technically you're better off staking ASAP, but a couple of days won't make a difference* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18794)

    @Benjamin --- *It's dependant on how much circulating supply  Based on historical data, Initially the rewards are very higher. I am expecting rewards to be more than 20% APR initially (As we have lot of interest from community for staking) . Could be very high also* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18614)

7. **team, great, project**

    @Armitpal --- *Dear Team, Kudos to your effort, your commitment is really making difference. Glad to saw your great team profile. I believe recent partnerships will take this project to new heights and will invite other big institutions as well.   I knows Infosys very well since last 10 years. My profile is of GovtTech  consultant so that with my experience in this field I can see a BIG Picture from here.  Really feeling proud as an Indian.  Cheers!!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18684)

    @Cheng --- *Honestly, can't believe how people don't understand how awesome this project is* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18705)

    @Brodd --- *Personally, I think the team is very good at bringing all parties together. Rome wasn't built in a day either. Of course I understand that people have used money to benefit from it. People did that with Amazon too .... Hopefully they didn't think after 6 months either, let me get out. At least now would have been a painful choice. Hold on, support the team where you can.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Synthetixi/18789)
