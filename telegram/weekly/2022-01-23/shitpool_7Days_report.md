    @BearishWhale --- *everyone knows Feb is gonna be magical for alts circulating supply addups, utiutiu* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717966)

    @besselBeat --- *Dominance of Alts excluding ETH update: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Wvw0tc8o/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717261)

    @MoneroPal --- *It’s not that complicated, fiat is king always has always will be. The institutions that trade billions per day of BTC are leveraged. They need to repay these loans with fiat so they take profits. This causes sell pressure on BTC which causes liquidations of mostly retail traders. Additionally, there is a lot of derivatives interset in the market from professional traders hedging. This causes further sell pressure. It’s all correlated to the macro market. Alt’s are wholly irrelevent, low liquidity, low volume, all worthless trash…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/718155)

    @besselBeat --- *Dominance of Alts excluding ETH: https://www.tradingview.com/x/koStx2UX/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/716698)

    @BeAMightyKing --- *I'm thinking similarly, as it's hard for me to see most top 20 L1s seeing significantly more upside without BTC 1st clearing $69k, past $100k & beyond.  But maybe this is old skool thinking and perhaps we've transitioned to a market where BTC & alts move up together without a surge in BTC dominance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717142)

9. **avax, matic, 20x**

    @MoneroPal --- *AVAX is dog shit, literally has one good project on it, and one DEX, nothing else, just another EVM, all this shit is truly worthless and is nothing more then exit liquidity for whales dumping on peasant commoners that thought they’d get rich with a couple thousand dollars* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717798)

    @brendanplayford --- *or development or liquidity program in the way lets say AVAX really, really, nailed* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717131)

13. **girl, onlyfans, decentralised**

    @BigBombo --- *It's a $10m market cap bet on decentralized onlyfans/Patreon/twitch/discord by top 3 overall and top growth crypto girl influencer* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/717566)

    @MoneroPal --- *It’s not about being a fan, it’s a scam, lots of people are getting hurt, I don’t feel bad for them, but they should be exposed, they have far too much power in their vertically integrated community* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/718487)

14. **solana, stuck, bridge**

    @da0man --- *SOL really drilling a hole today* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/719123)

    @wojackdegreate --- *I’m good, been in stables forever but I have a stupid amount of ust stuck in the wormhole bridge almost for 24 hours because Solana is pretty much down… stuck at 400 tps and I guess this thing needs 2000+ tps for a tx to be successful smh* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/719054)

    @Breddao --- *wormhole is also down for retrieving, even if you managed to send to it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/719112)

15. **metaverse, vr, victoria**

It seems extremely stupid at this point...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/715489)

    @Blazmeen --- *Tbh I'm surprised ppl don't generally consider the market audience for metaverses. Assuming we're talking about gamers - are they really going to dole out $100k-$2.5M to buy land off an investor? Or $XXX to rent it?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/715527)

    @MoneroPal --- *So it’s a good play to buy and rent out the metaverse to players?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/715529)
