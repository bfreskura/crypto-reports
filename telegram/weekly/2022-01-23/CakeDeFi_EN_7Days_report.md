If it’s rejected, it will tell you the reasons so you can try to fix it, and resubmit your kyc.  If you haven’t received any email, then I would say be a little patient. These things can take some time even though they say ‘usually within 24hours’  If you can’t wait any longer, you can contact support through this form https://support.cakedefi.com/hc/en-us/requests/new* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/166628)
