    @zhengshui1977 --- *OK, thanks. This tool is pretty easy to use. If I only need to hold 1000, I am willing to buy it. I probably wouldn't consider it if it had to be paid monthly, thanks for the help* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323441)

12. **cheesus, nft, ilo**

    @xbtwael --- *I saw Cheesus launched  https://cheesus.ai/en/main can you share what that is?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/326058)

    @Natalia_Ave --- *Cheesus provides pure data and objective metrics to give you onchain truth, but we don't give you any financial advices or fully ensure security of any project  So metrics for every project includes: - project profit and loss  - different types of holders e.g. traders, who bring life by selling and buying tokens, holders, who just hold tokens, do nothing with them, freeloaders who receive tokens by airdrop or any free distribution. Moreover we can track bots and fake wallets who pump prices and increase trading volume.  These data show how active the project are and you can conclude whether the project is worth investing in.  done* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/326087)

    @xbtwael --- *After the succesful fundraise, a common challenge for DeFi protocols seem to be adoption. What are some of the plans to stimulate adoption and build out the ecosystem around Cheesus?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/326098)

    @xbtwael --- *The Cheesus token is launching soon! Very exciting stuff, what kind of utility does it offer?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/326062)

    @Natalia_Ave --- *Cheesus is a multi-chain DeFi analyzer that helps users find real gems without getting caught in any mouse traps focused on NFT Metaverses.   We scan blockchains like google scan the internet, where you can find anything and besides open, easy to find and easy to use info we give inside information like real movements of token, amount of bots, fake and insiders wallets. After all this data helps you to decide whether the project is worth investing in or not.  Our main goal is to give onchain truth to users including all DeFi segments like NFT Metaverses, Trading, token movements, insiders info about token holders, flippers & diamond hands. done* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/326056)

    @xbtwael --- *Can you explain what Cheesus is? and what you guys are hoping to achieve?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/326054)

14. **alert, alarm, polygon**

    @rpoole69 --- *Just an FYI, the price alert bug hasn't been corrected yet, unless you prefix the alert price with 0. (for amounts under 1$) it will not save, @bastardganpunk could you please let the devs know, thanks!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324219)

    @bastardganpunk --- *which alert exactly are you talking about? i’m getting alerts under 1$* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324221)

    @stanes --- *Was reported few days ago: if you try to set the  alert without the 0 it doesn't save.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/324225)

    @DogecointotheMoon --- *please add % change price alerts!!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323563)

    @Uturn --- *One more question, regards to the price alert feature, is there a way that Dev team can create a one reactivate button to reactivate all the price alert within one token? It’s really a hassle to reactivate one by one for just one token.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325572)

    @zhengshui1977 --- *Thanks a lot, it's all set. Just a question, can the alarm only use USD as the trigger price? I think: 1. Alarm when btrfly/eth >1.1 2. Alarm when btrfly/eth < 1 How to set it up?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/323473)
