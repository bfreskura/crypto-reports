3. **ohm, ohm ohm, think ohm**

    @Reg --- *Fair question. I'm not an OHM expert by any means. From what I can gather OHM was created by some very smart people and has a decent shot at success. One big factor that I'm not sure about is the community. I don't see people building network/ youtube followings around OHM the way I do around some other successful projects. OHM could really benefit from that as it's future success depends on onboarding new users.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/147738)

5. **treasury, growth, treasury growth**

    @nfwaple --- *Dear Community,  Today we witnessed extreme sell pressure which led to another liquidation cascade.  However, we would like to make a few points clear to our community.     1. The treasury is as healthy as it has ever been:     Assets: LUSD     - $76,638,347.97 DAI      - $73,643,337.60 FRAX     - $40,015,181.80 WETH     - $33,863,695.17 vlCVX    - $33,438,030.47 Aave DAI - $10,634,851.31 tToke    - $7,152,010.46 veFXS    - $6,575,471.22 xSUSHI   - $1,790,874.49 inSpirit - $1,173,942.71 KP3R     - $1,029,489.34 ALCX     - $917,212.22 BCT      - $447,758.73 FXS      - $309,013.29 CRV      - $289,569.56 BTRFLY   - $250,754.86 pBTRFLY  - $40,000,000.00 or 10% of total supply pKLIMA   - $8,680,412.16 or 3.5% of total supply   Liquidity: OHM / DAI  - $157,882,507.88 OHM / ETH  - $57,113,080.66 OHM / LUSD - $39,163,186.37 OHM / FRAX - $22,198,175.88    2. The DAO is still on track to release many projects in the coming weeks and months:   Incubator/Grants Agora News Network Odyssey Olympus Pro: permissionless OP bonds Give/Tyche  Cross chain      - Proteus: gOHM partnerships and liquidity deployed on Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon, Fantom, Moonriver      - Cross chain: fully implemented Olympus branches with native tokens on all chains Bonds      -V2 bond deployment      -Hermes: tokenized bond market and yield curves  Liquidity      -Atlantis      -OHM Debtor function: Treasury asset + liquidity unlocked      -OHM V3 concentrated liquidity   3. We are committed to expand the utility for OHM in the near future together with our partners    Core-Partners :  Frax, Klima DAO, Redacted Cartel, Lobis, Alchemix, Dopex, Inverse, Tokemak, Umami Finance, Debt DAO, Vesta, Volt, Exodia, Liquity, Phantom DAO, Prime DAO, Spirit Swap, Fiat DAO        Olympus Pro Partners:   Ethereum Angle Protocol BanklessDAO BarnBridge Botto BlackPool DivineDAO Everipedia FiatDAO Float Protocol Gro Protocol Ichi Inverse Keep3r Network KeeperDAO mStable Pendle PoolTogether Premia Sandclock ShapeShift Synapse THORSwap Unslashed Finance   Avalanche  BenQi Growth DeFi Pangolin YieldYak   Fantom  LiquidDriver Scream SpiritSwap Spooky Swap   Arbitrum   GMX Treasure  4. Our revenue streams are growing daily:  Current Annualised Revenue:  OP - 20 million LP fees - 75 million Yield Farming + Staking - 110 million (and growing soon) Fee sharing agreements - 50 million   As seen today, leverage can be very dangerous and we strongly encourage caution when using it. We will hold a call tomorrow evening at UTC 8pm with the entire community to answer any questions you all might have.    As always, we appreciate all the support for Olympus and we close with a video Zeus made when we got started as a 10 million dollar protocol back in March. We believe a lot of it is still very relevant today!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/154650)

    @vdt153 --- *lets see if the treasury is really going to be distributed as you say. no point selling at these prices* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/165109)

    @Shane (4,4) (🍉,🍉) --- *While I agree with what you were saying about treasury.....I would say if the market maker gets gohm on a couple of good CEXs then you may regret this post....😂😂😂  This is what I am waiting on because at this point we need price appreciation....not more bonds and more minting just so the treasury gets richer.....NFA....just my opinion....😂😂😂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/148332)

    @Cixex --- *Let me clear my understandings. This is a very very long term investment. If you get lucky to have a whale pump the token, you would benefit.

    @nfwaple --- *manipulate what? the scale of manipulation wouldn't have been that big, it was amplified by liquidation.
