    @Flashbang665 --- *Hi, is there any issues with charts now?, the history of this chart is gone: https://www.dextools.io/app/bsc/pair-explorer/0x486697ae24469cb1122f537924aa46e705b142aa* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/316191)

    @napascual --- *Nothing to fix there. A candle normalization has already been done, those candles just cannot be avoided. That's just blockchain data. You can still stretch the candles to display the chart dates you're interested in.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320928)

    @Mojomagick --- *Please can you fix or tell me what the issue is:  The chart for AVT a few times wicks have been removed after a few days. This has happened on several different occassions for a few weeks.  For example yesterday  Price went to $1.82 But today that price was removed from the chart. Even though 2 transactions at that price are still on the transaction log under the chart.  https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0xcdff6ddfc9e4807c9927fd58708c2ef3484cc305  @napascual* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321028)
