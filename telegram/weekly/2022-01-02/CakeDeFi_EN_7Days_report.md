    @James --- *I've only withdrew once to kucoin. IS bittrex an easier option?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/155348)

    @Kassius84 --- *You need to withdraw your DFI via Ethereum Network as ERC20 Token. You need to define the DFI AS Custom token in your MM. Here you will find the needed contract adress and some further informations. But be aware of the high Ethereum gas fees 👍  https://blog.cakedefi.com/another-sweet-transfer-option-erc-20-version-of-the-dfi-coin/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/158544)

3. **fee, 130, ethereum**

    @falconheavy --- *is there a $130 address creation fees for USDT?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/157665)

    @Kassius84 --- *There is a one time deposit fee for Ethereum. It's caused by the high fees for creating a smart contract address in the Ethereum Network. Further deposits based on the Ethereum Network are free of charge on Cake side 😃* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/157937)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *Yes, that is a one time fee* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/157666)

    @falconheavy --- *damn! so I can't swap doge to usdt! But I don't understand how does creating a address cost you money? I created addresses all the time in everywhere and never cost me money except xrp* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/157672)

    @007 --- *Has anyone ever had problems with minor fees here? They take 50% of your original deposit in some cases. This charge is from Ethereum for using their net work to mine. Wow* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/157933)

    @falconheavy --- *ok boss!! your house your rules. No worries but I am not in a position to pay $130 for a address creation. I just sent eth to one of my other wallet and paid only $40 i think in gas fees so how come it is static at $130. I request this to be dynamic so that it can be more affordable atleast at time.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/157679)
