    @MoneroPal --- *Almost all crypto VC’s invest solely in equity not tokens* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/713550)

    @spaceVersity --- *What do you invest in Sir, equity or tokens?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/713555)

    @MoneroPal --- *Many dear ser are you in the VC space? Most VC’s do not want liquidity. They also need to be able to onboard investors and do things compliantly so equity is preferred. Most VC’s, even crypto focused, are registered in their respective jursidictions to onboard investors including offshore (BVI and so on) feeder funds. A few “vc’s” popped up, the gp was just some nobody who made a bit of money apeing his 9-5 salary into crypto, no even legal entity behind the funds.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/713558)

    @MoneroPal --- *There are a few tokens I like, but mostly equity, LUNA is one, UST has real use and it requires LUNA to mint UST. Trade finance, remittence, and general transactions, actual fundamentals on the Terra front. There are also many derivatives exchanges like Ribbon, Vega, DyDx and many more that are very profitable, again fundamentals, that are great investments. DyDx is the most profitable project after OpenSea.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/713557)
