1. **apy, apy dynamic, dynamic**

    @hemanrock --- *if iDYP, DYP, AVAX goes down, APY goes down. If iDYP, DYP, AVAX goes up, APY goes UP.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233693)

    @Cryptomommi --- *Ok...but the APY is so low..shouldn't any go up if people withdrawing?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232642)

    @hemanrock --- *%share, APY is dynamic and you can also check more on internet how yield farming works.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/233683)

    @Og_of_Satoshi --- *Firstly if yourself the maintainer of the project does know about how his project works, that gives a zero ground to attack me of having zero knowledge, you are using the same jargons it looks like u have rote learned it  Secondly I am mathematian and let me teach how a simple direct proportion   works. if the Apy is based on price as you say and not on the total deposit dyp. If price fell bay 50% the apy should fell by 50% making it 110% not 67* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231569)

    @timdyp --- *If you continue with this language, you will be banned. It is 100% decentralized, the APY is dynamic, it means it can go up or down. The APY can go up or down based on DYP, iDYP, and BNB price (if we talk about the BSC pools).* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231554)

    @hemanrock --- *APY is dynamic. When more users deposit, it can be decreased.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234967)

2. **fee, gas, fees**

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Here are some example https://t.me/dypfinance/229892 but again it depends on current gas fees so the fees cna be lower or more than in examples* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232895)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *Hey it depends on ETH network fees, so keep a track on that, also you will be charged less than what is shown on metamask* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232892)

    @hemanrock --- *However it depends on ETH network, no one can handle gas price.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232261)

    @Abulsagga --- *guys when i approve staking it asks for 200+ just for gas fees is that logical* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234058)

    @Mike_Hodl --- *I have approved it first but when I try to deposit it gives me the error* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234566)

    @Skipper_IM --- *And why fee is so huge? ERC-20 transaction can be 15-40 $. And fe can be 300-450 $ ???* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232262)

3. **idyp, price, dyp**

    @timdyp --- *No, you did not. It was clearly stated in all the articles regarding the new pools, plus discussed a couple of times here. DYP is no longer used for rewards, DYP is just a type of rewards like ETH, BNB, AVAX. What does it mean? It means you get the rewards in iDYP and the price of iDYP is converted to DYP based on market value. So based on iDYP and DYP price, you can see 100 DYP today and 150 or 50 DYP tomorrow. If the rewards are not claimed, they can go up or down.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231546)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *2H ago 2553 iDYP swapped for rewards and earned 8 ETH paid to LP's https://etherscan.io/tx/0x90be798fc54cf216239c1cbeec7e925ff497bffb2b2a4a8ad03737d6299fa409  2 days ago 1655 iDYP swapped for rewards and earned 4 ETH paid to LP's https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86b47e7bced976d8c631ad502bf5dbe23dd3a3273d958bc4885bf0f8f6653ecc  so you can see today more iDYP swapped which means more ETH paid* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234898)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *You can check iDYP price here https://info.pangolin.exchange/#/pair/0x66eecc97203704d9e2db4a431cb0e9ce92539d5a* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234015)

    @Og_of_Satoshi --- *It says 16 dyp not usd* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231526)

    @Mrbadboy2 --- *We can't look at dyp price* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234707)

4. **claim, rewards, trigger**

    @iamJubi --- *The time someone claimed was 1 hour earlier before the two days  reward, so the distributed reward was only for 1 day.   previous claim: 2 days 8 hours ago: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1b2799eba2b219ffbccef83844e45c02b824693b0a6064e2852da9f6c9fc8894  Latest claim 9 hours ago: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9cd8afcdf4156d880ddcb969cab380571655bb183692963201b61d8a49b53612* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231793)

    @DhoniMSD516 --- *On PC/Desktop you can hover on claim button to see tiem for next rewards* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231589)

    @Cricascar --- *Yes ,that is what I'm saying if you don't claim at the same hour you lose rewards right* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232404)

    @Cricascar --- *One question ❓ When the claim button says you are free ... But don't claim at that moment, let say 12 hours later, the rewards should be greater than what it shows right? But is not the case so I don't understand this part.   I put my situation, yesterday 10 pm UTC I could claim but done it today 12 hours later and I received the amount showed, so next time I can claim is tomorrow but the rewards from yesterday 10pm UTC to today 10 am UTC I have no rewards? Thank you* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232402)

    @thurlo79 --- *Hey guys it’s been just over 24 hrs since my last claim …   New rewards not in yet is this normal ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/234650)

    @Cryptomommi --- *Hello...newbie question...are rewards updated 1 time a day? Is there any particular time to check new rewards. I need to stop obsessively checking and get other stuff done haha.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/231582)

5. **idyp, token, idyp idyp**

    @Sir_Crys_alot --- *Can someone explain like I am five why iDYP is bleeding so hard?

Or not?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/232630)
