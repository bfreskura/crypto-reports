    @michaelams --- *But why didn't they transfer the NFTs first?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/308925)

    @freshaspect --- *He has moved all the NFTs to safety right?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/308904)

    @michaelams --- *Can't figure it out myself: he didn't fuck with hidden NFTs, seed words not shared or accessible, didn't approve anything except legit NFTs he bought/sould/minted. New to NFTs, didn't buy a Ledger yet...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/308899)

    @mdzor --- *https://twitter.com/cap10bad/status/1476900859460169732 sharing as I see that no one has mentioned it. It seems like doodle were the target yesterday and now there are more NFTs targeted. OS seems to have an exploit where a canceled offer may still be purchased 🤔* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312061)

    @PmRiviere --- *Thanks for shilling my claws but this claim is as unsubstantiated as it gets. How are NFTs any good at anti-Sybil?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312037)

    @michaelams --- *So you mean they waited on purpose with the NFTs to get extra ETH out? Sick* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/308919)

2. **airdrop, claim, gas**

    @zegdathetkan --- *Can someone help me understand what is the point of recent airdrops like GAS and SOS? it occurs to me they are airdropping before they have a working platform, why? what is the point? is this just a marketing stunt? is this somehow a scheme to make money by somebody? who is providing the liquidity?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311331)

    @Sp33dyTT --- *Hey guys there is apparently airdrop ongoing for wasted gas can anyone smarter with solidity knowledge have a look at smart contract? http://Gasdao.org* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311276)

    @banteg --- *is there any project behind sos or is it just an airdrop?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310500)

    @ethnoweth --- *Thanks @k06aa ser for creating this. We were planning to do an airdrop to reward early real world asset adopters. this is super helpful for us to design our upcoming airdrop. save us a bunch of time* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311621)

3. **hacker, hacked, wallets**

    @infomorph --- *Either people who "rolled their own" cryptography, or used faulty libraries with bad sources of randomness, most likely. A particularly sneaky blackhat could make a wallet that _very rarely_ reuses a nonce...get wide enough adoption, and even rare collisions will generate a steady stream of hackable accounts. This is one of many reasons why it's very important that wallets be open source (even then, could be hard to detect...see that random number generation standard the NSA backdoored for example).* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311242)

    @farm42 --- *TLDR: One guy’s MetaMask was hacked via infected smart sex toy (dildo). Never plug unknown devices to your working machine.  https://twitter.com/officer_cia/status/1475521089002475528?s=21* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310949)

    @michaelams --- *He can't access his wallet now, but will do it once he can. Needs ETH in there first too, haha* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/308908)

    @Georgeraven --- *I struggle to understand the grim finance hack maybe I am missing something specific about their protocol* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309021)

    @rata0x --- *I have friends at Bitfinex, lf anyone can help them to trace stolen 117k btc, they are willing to pay around a billion dollars.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311530)

5. **ban, share, chat**

    @yic_alex --- *You should remove both sides then. It's annoying to read half of those convos with no reference point all the time. (Not ban but remove the exchange)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309767)

    @samkazemian --- *It’s literally not on our end. We tried to be friends but they are literally the only project on the entire planet that seems to be hostile to us for no reason. So we have no choice. As you can see, we didn’t do anything to them. We’re friends with literally everyone.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309799)

    @adrianleb --- *messages were deleted because it was just another shill of the project which you're also just shilling in your channel, the ban was because you didn't stop there* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311845)

    @Cuter0x --- *Also, do You know what's the "bridge" section difference compared to the "router" one?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310613)

    @vPEPO --- *Polygon we already have a solution: https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/l1-l2-communication/fx-portal/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309179)

7. **contract, approve, uniswap**

    @SpikeSpiege1 --- *Like how the only change they made to uniswap code was adding in a small fee that goes to ambiguous dev wallet that isn't in uniswap code.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311143)

    @corp399 --- *https://etherscan.io/address/0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b#tokentxns  2022 looks like scam, but how did they do this?  If dev insert a specific code into the contract, can dev move the token without the wallet owner's approve?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311631)

    @tufuntu --- *In uniswap v2, why didn't they use IERC20 instead of selector?  https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L45  Anybody has an idea?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310940)

    @ChiTimesChi --- *Some tokens have ERC-2612 permits implemented, so you can sign an approval off-chain (thus potentially enabling gasless trades). Ivan's most favorite token supports that iirc.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310358)

    @ivangbi --- *Only after a DAO vote though ** **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309267)

    @kuzzel --- *In the interest of freeing @ivangbi of further moderation, would you be game of putting together your questions/points together and sharing them with me?  Sounds like I'd be doing everyone a favor if I just wrote a long form response via blog post, that people could just link to to get fully informed on the perspectives. That way it's less conversational and more 'here are the options and tradeoffs, you take the risk you think best fellow founders/DAO community members'.  Happy to write it with you if you're game* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311565)

    @river0x --- *DAOs are going to need good infrastructure. Whoever can figure that out as well as good DAO to DAO communication skills are going to be well suited for the next year - my addition* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310734)

    @warylow --- *I get coal.  https://twitter.com/juliankoh/status/1473917141061873664?s=21 I have noticed that I have completely ignored my LinkedIn for almost the entirety of this year, I have a hard time imagining that identity management is really going to take hold in crypto the way it does in traditional* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310246)

    @bout3fiddy --- *So: keep separate machine for crypto, dont download nonsense in there.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309091)

    @Don_Luv --- *Looking at this but don’t see how it’s crypto friendly. Are there some integrations I failed to see, or does it allow you to pay in crypto (just saw USD and EUR pricing)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311600)

    @RobAnon --- *Always go open source. Crypto ethos* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309293)

    @Sp33dyTT --- *I think its just because they all still has no clue what to do with crypto in general, hence different countries think up some crazy ideas depending on their hivemind in governance process 😂* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/311404)

    @lefterisjp --- *The "Crypto ethos" is a bit of a too loaded phrase. Whose ethos? Who is crypto? etc.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309304)

13. **source, opensource, open**

    @elie55 --- *Hey, want to get peoples thought on opensource. You have a split in crypto where half the tools are open and half are closed. Eg opensea could be opensource but isn’t. And uniswap is.  We’re considering open sourcing ourselves and would love to hear some of the pitfalls of taking that approach and giving away our “ip”* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309210)

    @bensams0 --- *if you stay closed source, the biggest way you retain value is by hoping nobody implements something better. if you go open source, your only way to retain value is bizdev/partnerships.  one of these things might be more sustainable than the other for your product* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309219)

    @FiveBoroughs --- *Generally speaking opensource backends, close source UIs/frontends will satisfy most of the community and make you composable while protecting from low effort clones* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309284)

    @lefterisjp --- *oh I am with you. My entire being is in opensource as evidenced by the project I founded and work on. Just trying to not alienate people who may not agree with my view but who are also in our field* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309315)

    @lefterisjp --- *I personally prefer opensource to source available but can understand somene doing source available but non-permissive license.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309303)

    @lefterisjp --- *That is not opensource. It's source available. I kind of wish we could find a better name for the 2 different things.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309301)

14. **ledger, trezor, ledger trezor**

    @raoufbenhar --- *What’s your guys favorite/best hardware wallet? Aside from ledger* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310842)

    @tufuntu --- *if we keep all in ledger, then all safe?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/309114)

    @mogglet --- *ledger nano s is still the best, I bought 2 nano x and both died upon arrival ( battery dead). Ledger team if you were here please fix asappp !* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310859)

    @yic_alex --- *Tbh it does not make much sense to not use Ledger/Trezor if you don't want to run into compatibility issues / lack of apps. It does not pay off to go for the non market leaders with those kind of things in my experience, especially when even those already kinda suck.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310854)

    @raoufbenhar --- *Even if it’s not the most simplest thing, I’m sure folks would be willing to pay top dollar for an upgrade over ledger/trezor* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310887)

    @zeThrouzz --- *my ledger screen died after 1 year, impossible to read it, the green color completely faded.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310867)

15. **cosmos, polkadot, substrate**

    @Swader --- *No, Cosmos is very much a chain, a hub bridging other chains.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312104)

    @Cat_Graphy --- *If L1’s are built on Cosmos SDKs, do the community view cosmos as a layer 0 or remain as a layer 1? Or is there no direct link between Cosmos SDK and Cosmos itself?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310918)

    @Swader --- *Substrate is the framework on which Polkadot and Kusama are built, yes.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/312099)

    @svenblockchain --- *I think all cosmos chains are independent, but interoperable.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310919)

    @cryptoq11 --- *Cosmos Hub it’s just one hub in Cosmos Ecosystem.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310920)

    @apindy --- *All Cosmos chains are sovereign and can run their own validator set. They are however connected via IBC* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/310921)
