    @Ap0l1o --- *easiest way would be via traderjoe on avalanche I suppose* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/137317)

    @Z --- *Ok I understand this part but now numbers on dashboard are wrong as I should have like near $1k more and if I bridge over to avax network shows I will get even less..so is this right that we lose some funds moving around? Or is there a issue somewhere or am I doing it wrong 😑  Sorry for all questions just want to understand what’s happening* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134998)

    @a320_ali --- *When I try to bridge, it doesn’t let me to switch from AVAX to ETH, its just stuck in “From Eth to Avax”* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/137272)

    @Jonno --- *Question then I’ve check that thanks say I now move this to avax and decide to unstake how will that work does it transfer back into standard ohm on avax in my wallet and at same ratio ie I’ll receive more because 0.04 ohm would mean it’s worth less than before migration ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/131984)

    @amkuo --- *where can i see document related this migration? whats is the purpose for this migration* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/136120)

3. **apy, year, oip**

    @nfwaple --- *assuming 5280% APY for the entire year and you don't withdraw any of them for an entire year, your total OHM would be 3 OHM x 52.80, but it doesn't make sense to be assuming that APY does not change for one whole year* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/140275)

    @vampyren --- *Maybe we should not have done all of it at the same time? like reducing and even talking about apy reduction when price is fast going down and other factors you mention :/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/139812)

    @Love3425436367564 --- *Knew youd say this. 7000% has been solid for almost a year now. Would be happy with that or even 5000%  More marketing & bonds = this can continue.  Bear market will rebound soon.  Dropping the apy too low is stupid and defeats the point of the project.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/133889)
