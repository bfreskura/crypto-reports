    @Lgbeano --- *Emurgo do not run any Yoroi channels. Any channel with yoroi in the name is scamming you* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/759081)

    @Lee --- *Hi - I am having difficulties connecting ledge to yoroi - any advice or should I use another app?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/756445)

    @ExInfernis --- *Hi, I have question for Daedalus and Yoroi. Can I have at the same time my ada on both wallets or when I download yoroi and create wallet there my ada will be transferred from the daedalus to yoroi?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/759102)

    @Hans --- *Yoroi just reads the data of your wallet. Use same credentials as in D!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758489)

    @p --- *Hey guys. I have some issue withdrawing and restaking ada on Yoroi. I’m using my Trezor T for my yoroi wallet and I transferred Ada into it 2 months ago, delegated it with no issue. Now I’m trying to redelegate it to a different pool and a message pops up on my Trezor, saying “change address payment credential is a path…” then when i tick the checkmark, it takes me to another prompt saying “change address staking credential is a key hash…” then to another prompt of a sum of my account minus the amount I’m trying to withdraw before taking me to the standard signing off that fails to go through. I’ve noticed the same problem on the forums in a few cases but there seems to be no definitive solution for this. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758585)

    @Nel --- *https://typhonwallet.io/#/  Is typhon.io for alternative cardano wallet legit? 👆* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/755261)

    @p --- *I tried. But when i try to use the recovery phrase on adalite it shows that my wallet has 0 balance. I’m sure this is the only set of seedphrase i have because I only have the one cardano wallet and I only wrote down one set of it. Checked it multiple times. The balance on yoroi and cardanoscan is correct tho* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/758603)

    @Moon --- *Hi. Can someone please explain why 2 delegates with the same amount of stacking hells in the same pool get different rewards?  The difference in the reward is 20-30%* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/756743)

    @srinivas2121 --- *Small question need suggestions...if I stake Ada coins in a pool where staking more than 60Millions..Ada..what are the disadvantages...ex: pool A  staking 18millions 1 month returns 4.8% , pool B staking more than 60millions 1 month returns 5%....both pools having same parameters..no difference.  Which will give more Ada....if user stake thier Ada coins .. pool A or pool B..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/760074)

    @Headelf --- *Thank you? Different stake pools are good?  Need to register each?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/760211)

    @tham3rr --- *Is there any news regarding multi pool staking? Can't be stock with one pool. I guess multi pool staking can help with rewards having better luck?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/757955)

    @You --- *Hello hello I am wondering if there is a quicker way to see what stake pools are doing with rewards (charity, interesting projects, etc), than going to each ones website and searching it out.  Is there some kind of categorizer in action somewhere? There are too many to be worth spending all that time.   If my only interest is returns, than it doesn’t matter, but if Im more interested in what its contributing to, then its more important.   Is there a quicker way?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/Cardano/757823)
