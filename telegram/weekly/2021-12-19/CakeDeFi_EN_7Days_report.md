    @Michael_Schredl --- *The DeFiChain Blockchain  had some issues and there were no new blocks.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/149299)

    @freedfidotcom --- *DeFiChain stalled due to a bug during the night - no blocks, no rewards. Not a Cake issue, a DeFiChain issue* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/148650)

    @jezzkng --- *Hello, there was issue with DeFiChain through the night. Now fixed - some time to get back up to speed, in other words, it'd reflect in your asset balance, just taking more time than usual. Our engineering team is on it fully. rest assured your fund is safe.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/148781)

    @freedfidotcom --- *4 days puts this beyond the timeframe of the bug in DeFiChain - I think all you can do is submit a support request then our team can investigate further for you. There is no known issue right now other than through the night with reduced blocks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/148869)

    @fabioandreatta --- *No that is not how a blockchain works. Nobody can force close anything* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/150778)

    @helix78 --- *Cheers for the price shootout and the success of DFI! Greetings to Singapore from Switzerland* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/146531)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *Yes that works, but only DFI* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/146337)

    @TruuMax --- *Dont forget, that you will need to put in the same amount of DFI* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/149555)

    @velo314 --- *You mean manually converted DFI are auto-staked? And you'd have to unstake them to, for example, LM? What's the downside to temporarily disabling auto? Just the manual hassle? I think we're all anxiously awaiting simple mode's return!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/152846)

5. **withdrawal, withdrawals, processed**

    @Daniel --- *Is there no support?? Been waiting over 72 hours for a withdrawal* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/148717)

    @YSL --- *I love the withdrawal checklist .. this is good* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/149786)

    @rhodium289 --- *I really dislike this stock response. It suggests that the 11 hours delay is due to some precautionary security measure (that we're being looked after) when we all know that it's because there are technical issues and so all transactions, rewards etc are blocked. This stock reply is disingenuous. It may be that some withdrawals will be ultimately be delayed because of checks, but really!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/149373)

    @freedfidotcom --- *I have just checked our system and there are no pending withdrawals over 72 hours.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/149686)

    @freedfidotcom --- *Yes me too - but to repeat, no withdrawal request is over the stated 72hr timeframe yet and the instruction to resume withdrawals has already been given - please be patient for just a short time more* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/149699)

    @Tom --- *Hi, is there a withdrawal issue. My withdrawal is now pending over 72h now.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/148796)

6. **eth, fee, address**

    @maxxzz89 --- *$100 for address Fee. So it will not be charged again for ETH transfer?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/150939)

    @AntWhale666 --- *Sweet, and also if i want to start LIQUIDITY FARMING with ethereum pair, do i need to first buy a ethereum wallet for 130$? is that true? i think ive read that somehwhere, if not i will be more than happy to sending some eth over right away and start out.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/150393)

    @Ru --- *Ethereum gas fee can be very high and has nothing to do with Cake. So indeed there is no fee for depositing but there is no way around the standard Ethereum gas fee.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/149525)

    @R --- *Wait $300??? Eth is expensive so i guess* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/152283)

    @Ru --- *I looked it up and it seems to be a one time Ethereum address creation fee. I remember getting a warning when I first deposited Ethereum and I was aware the fee existed. If there really was no indication anywhere while depositing USDC perhaps it was an oversight.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/149533)

    @☁️🍑 --- *Anybody knows roughly how much is the ethereum address going to cost me* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/149763)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *Normally within 24 hours, I would contact them again* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153168)

    @Happy --- *Apparently it only takes up to an hour on the defichain lightwallet. How come there is such a disparity between wait times?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153651)

    @Manvydasm --- *But always completed within 24 hours?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153649)

    @Careluna1201 --- *Is it just me having problems to withdraw to Kucoin?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/152832)

    @ashishsojan --- *Hi Michael, are we able to transfer DFI out from kucoin now?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/150074)

    @TimescapeHD --- *I transferred some dfi to kucoin just before transfers got deactivated on that exchange. I assume the coins will be credited as soon as maintenance is finished?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/150346)

    @nadastropovic --- *You can send your DFI on kucoin, then change it to USDT, use your UDST to buy Stellar, send it to your Coinbase Pro account, then sell your Stellar to USD or EUR and then whithdraw your money on your account. In Europe and Revolut it takes 5s to have the money on the account.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153390)

    @Jürgen --- *Hi Fabio, ist this also the reason why I cannot transfer DFI from kucoin to cake? Kucoin says „network upgrade“ - for 2 days now and I can’t do anything - their support also didn’t answer, yet* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/150768)

    @DmgBautista --- *Simple mode is currently not working, maybe tomorrow it is already, but for the moment, under maintenace still. But normal mode works fine!* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/150564)

    @DmgBautista --- *If you are then using the normal mode to add, it should work. Only if the team maybe disabled the option to add in order to implement the correction to the simple mode. Try again a bit later, maybe work already* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/150568)

10. **swiss, dfx swiss, dfx**

    @DmgBautista --- *Or you can send it to bittrex, convert into USDT and the USD or EUR, directly to your bank. Other option is DFX.swiss. Soecifically designed for DFI, no KYC under 900 EUR and with off-ramp capability ;)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153429)

    @Joel --- *What do you send? DFI? AFAIK CoinBase doesn’t trade DFI.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153409)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *You can only swap it on the DEX or create it by yourself* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/149395)

    @fabioandreatta --- *Click on DEX then click on swap and then click on the arrows to turn around* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/152363)
