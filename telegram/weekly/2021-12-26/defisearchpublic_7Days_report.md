    @Taylor --- *Hi guys, is bitcoin worth holding right now, what do you think?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/defisearchpublic/240212)

    @jaelquin01 --- *This amount is a non-inflationary fixed supply set at launch. 10% of the $VENI supply was distributed at the genesis event to Venice liquidity providers and stakers. The remaining 90% is distributed over the course of four years.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/defisearchpublic/240694)

    @CasperDeFi --- *We are live!  https://twitter.com/aag_ventures/status/1470000579460145155?s=20  --  A reminder of our pricing work for TLA:  TLA Pricing Mechanism  When an individual completes a purchase, the transaction will cause the AAG token’s price to increase. In contrast, when no purchases are initiated, prices will gradually decrease with the weight increasing.  Starting at $4.14, the price of AAG tokens will gradually decrease when no purchases occur. However, if at one point, for instance, at $3, there are large orders that have been successfully transacted, the price of the AAG token may also increase quickly. That means the price could also go above $4.14 and advance even higher if there are investors continuously buying.  In conclusion, an individual can freely purchase AAG tokens at any price they see fit, and that is the price they get. Eventually, the price will settle at a price the market as a whole finds most suitable.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/defisearchpublic/240171)
