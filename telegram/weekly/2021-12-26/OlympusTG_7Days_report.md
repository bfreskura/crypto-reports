    @syberk1d --- *I agree, things just don’t add up, I think Olympus have used an opportunity to reduce our reward yield percentage and covered it up by blaming it’s the migration* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/124928)

    @syberk1d --- *The less people that are staked into the project, the more the apy goes up,   I’m also confused here as what it looks like on paper is  More people have staked for it to drop in apy so drastically, when in actual fact we pretty much can safely assume it’s the opposite since the migration, more people have been uneasy with it, and complaining, so I put my money on it that more people would of no doubt in staked and got out, thus , the apy should of gone up due to this, I’ve lost a lot of faith in Olympus, I have more faith in my wonderland bag than Olympus now, feel like they have robbed us of nearly 50% of potential 3,3  future gains* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/124918)

4. **migrate, migrate gohm, migrated**

    @Ap0l1o --- *Yes, but it is advised that you migrate to gOhm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/119610)

    @XB_888 --- *Finally did my migration. Smooth, paid for two transactions....Approve $9,  Migrate $25.  I stop seeing my rebases since yesterday, so decided to do the migration. The rebases were added back and i m holding gOhm now.  Process was smooth, took less than 3mins.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125521)

    @K. --- *NVM it looks like it's all there. however I thought I migrated to gOHM and it's still showing sOHM* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/130522)

    @ibaniba --- *Hi all- there’s been a lot of chatter but I can’t seem to find what I’m looking for. My sOhm has been missing. I checked on etherscan and it shows that it was migrated and transferred to sohmv2 about 8-10 hours ago.  That said- Am now sure how to locate my sOhm as it’s not shown on my MetaMask nor the app.    Can anyone provide guidance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/120118)

    @DandC932830 --- *It’s weird because I migrated and nothing has changed on the main page. Why wouldn’t it now show gOHM?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/121633)

    @Stella --- *So I just migrated my sohm to gohm* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/121586)

5. **avax, gohm avax, avax gohm**

    @cdp279 --- *You can migrate do avax to avoid paying the huge eth gas fees, you don’t HAVE to. Also if you wrap to gohm you will get the governance benefits and you’ll be able to bridge to different networks* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/116809)

    @Henryift --- *Is it ok if I get some gohm in my eth mm and some gohm in avax? How is it displaying on my dashboard?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/128240)

    @jesceljames --- *Is there a way to track the potential earnings of gOhm? I traded my Avax for gOhm at trader joe.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/117517)

    @Colonelgaddafi --- *Loving the multichain ohm idea. Buying gohm on avax saves so much fees man.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/132179)

    @nfwaple --- *no need, just migrate to gOHM on eth, no need to go to AVAX, no need to unstake, read pinned message* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/128189)

    @nfwaple --- *LP only gOHM - AVAX pair, do you own research* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/128408)

6. **sohm v2, v1 sohm v2, migrate sohm**

    @theMagicUnicorn --- *it is already happening, you canmigrate now to gohm andyou will be all set, or you can wait a few days for sohm v2* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/118313)

    @theMagicUnicorn --- *v2 migration is in progress, they are working their butts off to make sure everything goes right, you can have ohm v2, sohm v2 and wshom v2 (gohm) right now though, so if you want to migrate right now, you can...just they are encouraging migrating to gohm now, but if you want sohmv2, just unwrap the gohm and you can have sohm v2.  altho you can keep the gohm and see the rebases on the app....if you prefer to go directly from sohmv1 to sohmv2 without wrapping to gohm and unwrapping to sohmv2, then just wait until they have that ready* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125470)

    @航 --- *When can sohmV2 be migrated? Now I sohm has no income.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/118281)

    @jeffru812 --- *Is the sohm on uni v2 or we would still have to migrate? Sweet dip* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/123604)

    @Ap0l1o --- *yes, you can migrate to gOhm or wait for sOhm V2 migration to be available* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/123672)

    @theMagicUnicorn --- *or wait few days for sohm v2 and migrate to sohm v2* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/118331)

8. **rebases, rebase, rebase sohm**

    @nfwaple --- *Olympus Migration TL;DR for the Ohmies  - Current sOHM won't see rebases anymore. will get all backdated rewards whenever you migrate. - Folks collateralised at Rari don't need to do anything. will be taken care of in the backend. - sOHM to sOHM v2 migration will become available soon. - sOHM to gOHM and wsOHM to gOHM migration is already available at https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/wrap - In no scenario will you lose rewards  The APY will show correctly on website when V2 migration is done. Current sOHM won't see rebases anymore. Ohmies will get all backdated rewards whenever you migrate.  Ohmies collateralized at Rari don't need to do anything. Everything will be taken care of in the backend.  You don’t have to unstake or do anything right now. sOHM to sOHM v2 migration will become available soon with easy step by step instructions.   sOHM: wait for migration to sOHM v2 or wrap to gOHM wsOHM:  convert to gOHM gOHM:  nothing fsOHM (Rari): nothing* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/120083)

    @KingMozzie --- *Yep, you will need to migrate sOHM to gOHM or sOHM v2. But other than that everything else like your rebase rewards will be updated automatically* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/117903)

    @KlimDao --- *I can see my gOHMs on my avax MM however nothing in the OHM Dashboard. I no longer see my rebase, nothing at all and that since yesterday.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/118581)

    @Martin --- *I own wsohm, do i still get rebase ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/130934)

    @cdp279 --- *you have gohm, gohm doesnt grow with each rebase* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/130323)

    @nfwaple --- *won't see rebase till you wrap to gOHM, you need to do it within 2 months from now* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/122401)

9. **staked balance, balance, staked**

    @nfwaple --- *you unwrap to get the number of Staked balance you see in the Stake page, gOHM is like a box, every rebase you get more sOHM in the box but you'll always only have 1 box* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/130005)

    @nfwaple --- *when you expand (there should be a down arrow next to the Staked balance), you can see sOHM v2 0, and only gOHM balance showing, gOHM is already v2* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125618)

    @nfwaple --- *if you're on the Eth chain you can see your equivalent staked balance in the Stake page* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125491)

    @CryptoCobiUSA --- *Hello! Can someone explain how I can see my actual value of gOHM after it has been staked ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/134143)

    @nfwaple --- *you can actually see your balance increases in the stake page even when you're holding gOHM, it calculates it for you. But if you fancy spending gas for another transaction, when you unwrap now it should already be sOHM v2* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/124785)

    @Al_S1919 --- *oh I see now. So it shows the staked balance, not sOHMs. In this case, the dev team should correct this so as not to confuse users.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/122088)

10. **ohm, long, long term**

    @etoshioliver --- *I got in at $600 months ago; I'm not worried $OHM is at Bitcoin hundreds price range. The long-term will be promising.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/125301)

    @adrian_squared --- *Sold all my OHM. What a shame.  Will buy agin around 230-250. Next week. Good luck all.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/126343)

13. **rebases, missed rebases, rebases migrate**

    @dongigante --- *OK, thx. So I got it right before and was confused by reading ,,eventually you will not receive any rebases until you migrate" So I will receive the missed ones after migration.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/128710)

    @nfwaple --- *that's right as far as I know, migrate to get compensated if you missed any rebases* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/121813)

    @Ap0l1o --- *If you don’t, then the rebases will stop after some time, but when you migrate eventually, you will get all the missed rebases.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/122677)

    @shogunfx1 --- *Yep that's right, your rebases have not been reflected just yet, so you'll need to wait! Unfortunately.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/OlympusTG/129450)
