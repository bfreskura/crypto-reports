    @luxevinco --- *There is no avax wallet app yet right, this might be a scam @admin* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313858)

5. **collateral, loan, orca**

    @euroog --- *There's no interest, only the payback fee, as far as I understand. If you use AAVE or BenQi you GAIN interest on your asset, ie. it increase in value, and you can use that as collateral in Orca. So you can loan against it at zero interest in Orca, while the underlying asset has yield and increases in value* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313227)

    @euroog --- *Might I suggest you jump into the Orca telegram and ask these questions? You can borrow to the limit of the LTV. If your borrow percent increase above the LTV because of decrease in price of your collateral you get partially liquidated. You can borrow as little as you want. The only restriction is that you can max borrow up to the percentage specified by the LTV, eg. 70%. Each vault states the LTV so you can see what you maximally can borrow.  YieldYak is the only platform whose interestbearing token receipts can be deposited into Orca. Here's a video on it, but they've added more vaults since it was published: https://youtu.be/zft6CenpjAU* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313477)

    @A --- *It's incredibly important for any borrower to know specifics about interest charges. But I'm not finding clear answers about this. Just that you can have a stable rate, or a variable rate. If you choose stable, is there a way to see what the interest rate WOULD be if you borrowed? It could be possible to get wiped out by accumulating interest, and if you can't plan for a locked-in amount, seems to me you're going in blindly, and the risk is too high.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313136)

    @A --- *It's starting to make sense. Thank you. I don't think I've read anything about periodic (eg monthly) loan repayments. Is that because this over-collateralization-with-crypto system doesn't require it? I've read that with some DAOs/systems/projects, you can hold on to the loan as long as you want as long as the amount borrowed in the loan-to-collateral ratio doesn't go higher than allowed percentage of collateral. So if this is the case, then you can pay back in portions, on a regular or random periodic basis, or all at once, when you choose to?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313135)

    @euroog --- *So you'll automatically get interest on your collateral while being able to loan against it. And no probs, anytime* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/312793)

    @A --- *Did anyone ever answer this? And to add to it, if the 1:1 ratio of deposit to collateral doesn't earn anything, does the collateral that exceeds the loan amount earn?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/312773)

6. **usdc, usdc usdc, native**

    @Andy_oi1 --- *Does the launch of native USDC effect USDC.e in any way?? Do we have to convert our USDC.e to USDC?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313743)

    @vm_machina --- *whats means native usdc. menas that usdc.e is going to be usdc ?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313259)

    @aco1731 --- *Usdc.e is controlled by what entity?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314366)

    @A --- *Are people using funds they get from borrowing crypto (with crypto as collateral) for anything other than investing in more crypto? Seems a little pyramid-ish, if nothing is cycling into goods/services of any kind.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/313168)

10. **lydia, ifo, rug**

    @RealRager --- *‼️ Lydia Finance Red Flag. ‼️  Red flags in the following projects.  A few days ago I already reported that Everst was a scam and they were making a soft rug. Today they have been hacked they say, coincidence.  I also warn about AvaoFinance, ridiculous project without foundations and without product and that from the first moment they receive a liquidity that they keep and the price of the token from the first moment sinks.   But who is behind all this is Lydia Finance, which sooner or later will do the same. Make no mistake, every IFO is an opportunity for soft rug. They thought they found the goose that laid the golden egg, but they have really dug their grave. Run away from Avax Lions.  Run away from Lydia while you still can.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/314414)

    @Yoopez --- *Lyd team is pushing ruggers as Polarbear on EVRT and took their 200k cut on the IFO. Don’t care at all for the current rug cause they are slow ruggers as well. Just look how they manage : EVRT, Avao with inside trading & the strange TVL decreasing from 25M to 13M and dumped their lyd during the Maxi IFO.
