5. **dusd, usd, dtsla**

    @itmlgife --- *Hi BrokeFeller, you didn't lose 514$. The current value of DUSD is roughly around 1.32$. You should be able to confirm that by checking the USD value of your DUSD balance in Cake.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/152088)

    @Tim --- *As I understand it  dUSD and several other dTokens offered by Cake are bought from the defichain dex which for example have dUSD at 1.30 USD. This problem is being looked into at the moment.. and when it is solved the value of dUSD will become circa 1 USD.. which in turn will represent a loss for anyone holding dUSD who bought it in the last few weeks when the value was 1.30 USD like it is now.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/153194)
