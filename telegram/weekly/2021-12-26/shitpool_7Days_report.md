    @MoneroPal --- *lol taxes on when not selling to fiat on a CEX? ser…* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/710985)

    @wojackdegreate --- *If ur in us and did more than 700 trades you can get the tts trader deductions* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/707969)

    @MoneroPal --- *Has nothing to do with feeling better. It has to do with the absolute retardation of reporting defi transactions to the IRS. There is absolutely no purpose whatsoever to doing so. If you’re converting crypto (asset) to fiat (USD) you will be presented wth a 1099-misc from whichever CEX. You owe taxes then.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/711018)

    @MoneroPal --- *Doesn’t matter what they are, what matters is enforcement, for which there is currently ZERO. The IRS is chronically underfunded and has so far not gone after any on-chain transactions. They’ve been doing the same old, go after under reporters that were issued 1099’s and did not pay their taxes. I doubt this will change in the near future, likely another 3-5 years minimum.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/711024)

    @MoneroPal --- *Coinbase does not report, unless it is sold into fiat and you’re issued a 1099-misc if you’re an Americuck. No reason to use Coinbase for anything except on and off ramping.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/710994)

Why would I want to hide it? It is checked by default. I generated one with and one without the checkbox checked for different periods.
