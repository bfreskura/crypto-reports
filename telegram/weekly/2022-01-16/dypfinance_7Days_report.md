    @Tom --- *I had participated in 3 Avax farms in V1 and exited all farms in last November. When I connect my MetaMask accounts to DYP farm airdrops, I still see iDyp deposited and locked there with rewards. This iDyp deposited is not withdrawable now it seems. However I can claim rewards there. When will the deposited iDyp be unlocked?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/239479)

    @Tom --- *I understand this wrt V2 farm. But I m referring to the Avax farms which I exited in November. It must be V1 then. When I connect the MetaMask account after clicking Dyp/ airdrop in Avax network, i see a page with my iDyp deposited and I am earning rewards. When I click withdraw that, it cannot be withdrawn. This MetaMask account has no V2 farm connected to it. So, I wonder I m still having this iDyp locked even though I pulled out of the farm? How or when can I withdraw this iDyp?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/dypfinance/239483)
