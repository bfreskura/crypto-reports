    @Kassius84 --- *I can understand that well 😂😃  But be patient, most withdrawals are processed in under 60 minutes.  Only very few need the maximum time of 72 hours.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159192)

    @AIex_78 --- *Some News? My LM withdraw pending aince 9 hours.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159305)

    @KBerger --- *Thats not true. Every of my withdrawels needed more than 24 hours. Maybe they are to big to do it automatic. But it sucks anyway. Should be good if i can decide to set up my security Level lower to have faster payout* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159196)

    @BillsGate --- *Im trying to figure out why whatever Action I take the only avail funds are the interest earned. I can not seem to touch the actual amount I allocated* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159576)

2. **announcement, announcement channel, twitter**

    @fabioandreatta --- *We announced this the 2nd of January for the first time* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/161954)

    @BerndMack --- *there is a question on twitter in exactly this direction:  https://twitter.com/cakedefi/status/1480863995322060800* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163463)

    @AivernT --- *No worries man, i rather have healthy discussions and engagement than silence from the community. This is a community as everyone seems to be saying after all right? Yet whenever there are any concerns or questions the answer is always "that's how it is. We cant do anything". And while that may be true, a reply like that without any further information is not gonna inspire confidence. Mind you, im speaking entirely from my own experience here, and im in both cake and defichain's tele and discord groups. Out of respect that you took the time to reply, i'll share my thoughts about why i feel this way.  1. I think we fundamentally agree about the exchanges, so there's nth to add here.  2. Well, on paper and "technically", they are unrelated, but if you're telling me that Julian doesnt have a massive influence in the direction of the project then i have to say you're being disingenuous. Take first twitter discussion that took place during the atomic swap issue. If julian was so far removed, why was he the only one who spoke then and why was he behaving like a CEO of both cake and defichain? Why was he the only one to lay out all the possible options? Because he was the smartest and most articulate person in the entire community? If that is the case then no amount of "decentralization" can disassociate him from the project. Look, i dont really care that he heads everything, but i feel like the community is holding him too high on the pedestal, and having DMOR on him, i cant say i fully trust that he has the best intentions for the project and i feel like people throw the term decentralization like it's some utopia when in actual fact it is absolutely not. BUT THIS IS PURELY MY PERSONAL OPINION. If i get killed for this then this place has become more of a cult than i realized lol.  All that said, i still believe this project has quite a long, maybe 2yr run way at least. I have no faith in the road to 50, but i think the road to 20 is doable. Again, this is my own personal view, but the way the community is running this, im not convinced it will be a massive success. I quite like this interpretation of decentralized finance and tokenized assets, but i have very little faith in julian and the rest of the team and how they are running everything. Smart technical ppl for sure, but that alone isnt enough to drive adoption.  My own investment in this project is a reflection of that. Im still here for the ride and if it happens i will cash out at $20.  I really appreciate you taking the time to reply, if everyone was like you and not just defensive everytime people had question, the project would get alot more adoption, but what a pity.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/161543)

    @fabioandreatta --- *There will be a Twitter Space in around 5 hours where this is discussed* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159654)

    @PeterL1 --- *And nobody is talking about voting which is new to me. Since support say it is maitenance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163030)

    @<UNK> --- *Taking own sweet time to vote and blah. Solve it already* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/161430)

4. **scammers, scammer, scam**

    @super33max --- *Scammer are getting smarter and smarter.  This is just an idea: Why moderators don’t put their username in their photo? (Like a water mark)  So, when scammer write you, you can click on their profile and see the mismatch between the username and the username written in the photo.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/162323)

5. **cake, withdrawals, withdrawal**

    @DmgBautista --- *I'll try and ask it someone on the backend can check. At Cake, any withdrawal equal or bigger than 10k$ is manually reviewed without exception  but if you inform that it was efectivelly withdraw, then it needs to be seen.   If you wish, you can also make a support ticket for the below email  https://cake.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163443)

    @AStron6 --- *I know but trying to skim some arb. I know each withdrawal is manually reviewed, but I think there needs to be a way to have pro cake accounts so this is automated* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164049)

    @enalettin --- *Maybe this is not the best time to reiterate my past criticism but it is better for the future of cake to make the withdrawals fast, easy and seamless however much cake insists that it is not a cex both withdrawal and deposit timings very important for customers.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/159066)

    @Albert --- *Can I clarify that is my interpretation is correct? If I want to LM dbtc-DFI. The cake is swapping at 1 dfi = 0.00007076dbtc and kucoin is trading at 1dfi= 0.00006328 BTC, is it better to swap using cake?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163179)

    @Cam --- *Can you swap btc for usdc (and vice versa) on cake?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/160782)

    @DmgBautista --- *You can therefore place te swap request and as soon and finished, you'll receive BTC in ypur Cake account. After that, just use therefore normal mode (since you'll have both coin pairs after turning half your DFI into BTC) and join the pool :)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/164435)

    @Paulius --- *I have tried swaping DFI to BTC. On CakeDefi app.   And i get the message that swaps are only allowed to DFI. So i get rewards in DFI crypto currency, but can not swap DFI to other cryptos.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/163277)

9. **price, dex, dex price**

    @Kassius84 --- *What are you expecting to happen with your dTSLA Tokens? Price of the Tokens depends on supply and demand of dTSLA on the DeFiChain DEX and is not depending on the price outside DeFiChain.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/160059)

    @Kassius84 --- *https://www.defichain-value.com/d/-aHOfMT7z/03-stocks?orgId=1 https://www.defichain-analytics.com/vaultsLoans?entry=dTokenPrices  Only during minting, the oracle-price is used. Otherwise the DEX-price depends on supply and demand 👍* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/165297)

    @Kassius84 --- *They have a connection to real stocks while minting of new dTokens. After that, if you buy or providing liquidity, the price only depends on supply and demand on the DeFiChain DEX. Here you can find some more informations https://blog.defichain.com/what-are-decentralised-stock-tokens-and-how-do-they-work/* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/160083)

    @Dutch1987 --- *The price on chain will always be a little bit more expensive i guess* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/160064)

    @resinio --- *One question: why is the price of dfi within the cake system not coherent with dex price when it comes to exchange? I was just checking the price vs. dusd, usdc, and I don’t come to 3.58 $ where it is now on the Dex.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/160415)

14. **staking, staking rewards, liquidity**

    @Sander --- *Quick question about staking. I thought staking rewards should be fairly stable in terms of dfi rewards. But it's changing quite significantly, the last 12 almost half of what's common. Would anyone be able to explain this? Is it related to the dBTC issue? (I don't see how it would)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/161542)

    @Stephan --- *Hi all, a quick question: If Liquidity Mining yields higher APY than Staking, why should I bother staking if I can get higher returns on LM? What are the downsides to LM?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/161007)

    @Seraphim_1986 --- *Why the staking-rendite is changing so much in last time. It was 31.9 now 42%? 😅 There are many people who change the offers?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/160873)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *That is not staking, that is Liquidity mining - take a look at https://app.cakedefi.com/liquidity-mining* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/160930)

    @Michael_Schredl --- *Staking Rewards are dropping 1.65% every ~ 2 weeks - also, more and more users are joining* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/160878)

    @mm_phoenix --- *exactly you get $30 in DFI and another $5 in DFI through learn and earn. The staking yield is currently 39.1% APY. This refers to the number of coins. No one can tell you how much the coins will be worth in 6 months.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/CakeDeFi_EN/160621)

15. **freezer, freeze, 10**
