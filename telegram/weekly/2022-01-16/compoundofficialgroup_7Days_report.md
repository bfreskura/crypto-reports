10. **dca, dca dca, dca way**

    @Elizabeth_166 --- *Not alot of people DCA But for me, i do that alot* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/30138)

    @Sophia4558 --- *A DCA and hold from this point will undoubtedly reap massive dividends. I only started 6 months ago.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/27586)

    @Bakker --- *It is… you never seen the phrase DCA in, DCA out?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/27100)

    @G14t2 --- *I wouldn't say it's hypocrisy. It's just normal uncertainty.  Every other "analyst" with a chart and YouTube channel was saying we would hit 100k by December, and then it dipped. Then it dipped again. Each time experts were saying this was bottom. Golden Cross, Stock to Flow, "Institutions are buying in now", experts were saying "100k in a few months".  It's not hypocritical to want to reconsider when your expectations didn't turn out, it's rational. Otherwise we'd be like the QAnon people who expected JFK to show up.  The only strategy to DCA right now, but to say it's ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE for us to go to 32k and stay there for the next 18 months is just denial.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/29474)

    @Aw1223 --- *The sooner you realise this and just DCA, you can spend the better part of your time doing something else that is more productive.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/28537)

    @c_dias4 --- *DCA in > DCA out, is the best strategy! 👀👌* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/27096)

    @Aw1223 --- *Just a reminder, don't forget staking your coins, it's a game changer.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/28860)

    @Aw1223 --- *Staking is a self-enforced HODL and when the price is going down at least you get some yield.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/27077)

    @Cassandra --- *Staking is a self-enforced HODL and when the price is going down at least you get some yield.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/27083)

    @Alvaro_467 --- *If it's not a proof of stake coin, 'staking' actually means 'lending', which means it'll immediately be sold. Sold for pure shorting reasons, or to put the sellers name on a sports stadium, or whatever.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/30164)

    @Grace_0978 --- *Is it so crazy to start say trading in bear market?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/28562)

    @Antonie --- *It's really difficult to say we are in a bear market  now or not. It really depends on were you draw the line on the chart.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/28434)

    @Cassandra --- *Unless we entered a bear market, I think you’re right sir* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/28589)

    @k_arlsson --- *Easy, Bear market is a period between two bull markets. Never talked about while going up, and screamed about at any sign of nervousness. Most importantly you never know if your in one before its over.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/compoundofficialgroup/28812)
