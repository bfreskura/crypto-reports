We never remove anything, we display what is available on the blockchain.  But once your token is live on our website it will be on the first result if it's the one with the most txs.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/322129)

    @Shauno73 --- *Thanks for vid. I'm pretty well versed in this stuff. Since update I've found this issue.

That's all it needs. A refreshed connection.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/322778)

10. **scammers, scams, scammer**

    @solDevW3 --- *This excuse is unacceptable. You need to be more proactive as to ensure scams are not listed on your platform. This will go very far to help investors in their efforts not to get scammed. This will also help the market and your business fight back against bad actors. Your lame excuse is encouraging the continued listing of these scam projects. I suppose yo will only take action when you’re sued and have to pay a few millions to a class action of investors fed up with this lacks approach to security.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/322624)

We have some ways to alert people of a scam like the "contract details" and the community votes. Can we do more? Yes, we are working on adding more tools to reduce the risk for our users to fall into scams. But be sure there is no way to be secure if you don't DYOR.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/325424)
