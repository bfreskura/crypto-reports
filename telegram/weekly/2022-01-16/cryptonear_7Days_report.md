    @iamkemoo --- *I know a trick:  You create a Testnet wallet and then you go to https://testnet.burrow.cash/portfolio (Near Testnet) and test the DApp. With a little luck you get Airdroped some $BRRR when they go live. Then you swap those to $NEAR and et voila..* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/284794)

    @RNFarm --- *@hai vu  Purpose- simply to explore the workings of the project. I desire to know who makes decisions and the checks and balances in place before before making a long term investment.   The project seems excellent. I agree ownership should be in the hands of the community (at least long term), but transparency is important to ensure that not only consensus order is decentralized but also governance (ie. business decisions and logistics are not made by "unknowns" or an individual group or person)* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/259375)

    @rahulgoel007 --- *You can stake $Near and earn $Near back (~11% APY) Guide -> https://t.me/cryptonear/154221  On Metapool you can liquid stake $NEAR and get $NEAR(~ 11% APY) + $META {Liquid staking --> Instant Unstake by paying extra fees} Guide--> https://www.producthunt.com/posts/meta-pool  What's $META?

    @GeorgePro1 --- *1. MetaPool (https://metapool.app/dapp/mainnet/meta/#)  distributes the tokens proportionally to the validators, so no worries which validator to choose. 2. You still get ~11% APY on your $NEAR, and withdraw NEAR whenever you want without waiting (with fee). 3. On top of that you get MetaPools $META token payed out daily 4. You get stNear which can be used on other DeFi applications such as app.ref.finance* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/cryptonear/284041)

    @iamkemoo --- *Because  1. MetaPool distributes the staked $NEAR tokens proportionally to the validators, so no worries which validator to choose. 2. You still get ~11% APY on your $NEAR 3.
