    @polnyrazyob --- *Can someone explain what is happening with market?

    @xnatasx --- *Btc is the most decentralized. Had the fairest launch. Is the most secure. Is basically free to send over lightning. Has a fixed supply with reducing inflation...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/233948)

    @Me_Jakob --- *BTC is most decentralised- but governments can control miners, miners can control price. Isn’t it? BTC transactions are quantum vulnerable. It’s just a matter of time when China or whoever else will reach quantum supremacy. And lightning network is just and banking system as big coders says.. Maybe I’m wrong and I need some deeper research, but in comparing BTC with NXS it’s still a lot of things that BTC is missing.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/233950)

    @Me_Jakob --- *Nexus is a scalable, quantum-resistant blockchain securing an uncensorable and free internet through a hack-resistant Operating System. Nexus’ integrated API makes developing decentralized applications (DApps) easy with “no-code” web tools like Bubble. Create tokens and assets (NFTs), design contracts, or use our templates. All our features are available on the public network or a private (hybrid) chain.  I’m just a maxi of $NXS and soon next big update is coming. I wish some of peoples who are familiar with programming or development - take a look on Nexus blockchain and what they are doing. Wish you all the best ❤️  Here you can familiarise with Nexus and it’s features. I hope it will be interesting for you to read:) https://devdocs.nexus-interactions.io* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/de_fi/233730)
