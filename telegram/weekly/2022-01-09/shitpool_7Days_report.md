    @rocket_fuel --- *why is he wearing a hospital gown* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/715073)

    @MoneroPal --- *Jake wouldn’t look any different if they didn’t.  They’re both just really low class uneducated commoners that got propelled into money and stardom because somone else is making more off of them. Likely will be broke like most, only one I respect in the scene is Canelo Alvarez, doesn’t even belong in the same sentence as them.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/713968)

    @BeAMightyKing --- *Hmm yeah, I guess whoever designed this is a BTC minimalist lol* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/shitpool/713324)
