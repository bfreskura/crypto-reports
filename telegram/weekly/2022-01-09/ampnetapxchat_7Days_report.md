1. **ampnet, greenpeace, clients**

    @Bob_Fosse --- *That was basically a very long winded statement that reads, “ampnet did nothing wrong, it’s everyone else’s fault”. Just awful (and not surprising).* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36017)

    @mislavjavor --- *Hey @IncogSen - the breakdown of Greenpeace partnership and the Aeternity attacks were all announced as they happened. The onboarding of new clients and the decision to develop AMPnet v2 was also communicated when it happened. There was no hiding of information from our side - when we had nothing to say, we stayed silent. When we had new partners or developments - we announced them, as was expected from us.   The optimism in our announcements was how we felt at the time, it was a genuine excitement that we felt - but we couldn’t know how things would end before they ended.  I understand the frustrations, but information was not witheld.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36007)

    @IncogSen --- *Maybe they already knew about the greenpeace deal falling through behind the scenes* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36013)

    @matejmz --- *I am wondering how you can become a main sponsor of a club with such a large following while being only a small start up with rather bad start. 🤔* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36078)

    @mislavjavor --- *I agree, and the team finds ourselves more than accountable for things in and beyond our control. In the history of our company, there has never been an attitde of - “it must be somebody elses fault”. We should have acted sooner on red flags by Greenpeace, we should have moved on to Ethereum sooner, etc… Trust me when I say that we do not pat ourselves on the back saying “good job, it’s the fault of the clients”. On the other hand - it’s easy to look on things from hindsight - with all the extra information that hindsight provides.   The post was meant as an update to the community, that we are working hard, exploring new business models and new clients and that AAPX will be the token that’s backing these new developments.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36027)

    @Bob_Fosse --- *Nope, I just thought that was a very bland message from Mislav that read, “greenpeace was at fault not us, trust us”* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36021)

    @BlinkmothNexus --- *Sorry but how does the polygon adresse helps me to claim my presale token?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36171)

4. **aapx, year, platform**

    @<UNK> --- *This is due to the fact that AAPX unlocks linearly and sites like CMC or CoinGecko have "unlock date" which we cannot use, cuz appx is unlocking every moment instead of a set date  But anyone can check circ. supply/max supply here -  https://claim.ampnet.io/app/dist/index.html* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36149)

    @E_Don --- *We need more pairs on Matic. Eth gas fee is crazy  Matic/AAPX. Eth/AAPX* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36085)

    @whimofnature --- *having a large partner helps a lot of course, but crypto-space itself can be fund-raising .. even for fund-raising technologies. IMO the main problem what keeps people from looking at AAPX is that there is no circulating supply visible for the AAPX token. this causes the token to be ranked somewhere in the >10000 rank area. nobody looks at this. if there was a circ. supply information it would be immediately ranked lower, and people would look what the project is about. and then they would be fascinated, because everyone knows real estate / equities on blockchain is the future. and then they would buy AAPX.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36136)

    @matejmz --- *Matic/AAPX exists. You can swap ETH to Matic and then swap it for AAPX* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36086)

    @E_Don --- *Why's AAPX price dropping to zero?Is this project still alive or dead?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/35862)

    @matejmz --- *Prepare for the "what is circulating supply?" questions 😆* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36139)

5. **tokens, march, released**

    @PFCBLic --- *Can we put final date and final ammount of released tokens? Mcap wont be correct but it is better than nothing* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36153)

    @MarcusVieiraCosta --- *will there be the promised tokens for us that made the cryptobond with Sync?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36114)

    @<UNK> --- *As @matejmz said, when all tokens are released in March, we will solve this vesting problem* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36168)

    @matejmz --- *Only few unreleased tokens are remaining til March so it would make sense to do that...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36165)

    @whimofnature --- *yeah, or just provide daily/weekly unlock dates to CMC & co, that mimic the linear release schedule ...* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36162)

    @matejmz --- *Also after 8th of March there will be no new tokens for whole year. It would be cool to have this visible.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/ampnetapxchat/36147)
