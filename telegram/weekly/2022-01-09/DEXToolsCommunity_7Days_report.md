1. **chart, charts, data**

    @napascual --- *Nothing to fix there. A candle normalization has already been done, those candles just cannot be avoided. That's just blockchain data. You can still stretch the candles to display the chart dates you're interested in.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/320928)

    @Mojomagick --- *Please can you fix or tell me what the issue is:  The chart for AVT a few times wicks have been removed after a few days. This has happened on several different occassions for a few weeks.  For example yesterday  Price went to $1.82 But today that price was removed from the chart. Even though 2 transactions at that price are still on the transaction log under the chart.  https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0xcdff6ddfc9e4807c9927fd58708c2ef3484cc305  @napascual* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321028)

14. **honeypot, dext, scams**

    @JoeyDieleman --- *Yeah thats sad, the whole purpose of DexTools if to give you info to not fall for scams, only buys, low score no public contract should give people red flags, of course even then dextools can never be 100% accurate, there will always be a fight between detecting scams and scammers comming up with new things. Please use dextools as intended and always do extra research on top of that. See the socials and check those too (and don'y fall for bots saying all the time the project is awesome and 100x is the only way). But for the tokens you gave, Dextools is pretty clear.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321274)

    @VISAFinan --- *Why DEXTools was listed scam coins* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/319355)

    @Katana_Crypto --- *You're right. I'm usually diligent and always warn others. It was new... And I couldn't check it on the usual sites. I don't remember where I saw it, but there was a check next to HONEYPOT SAFE, and I believed it. There were so many others dropping large ETH into it.   Etherscan showed people selling it to Uniswap...through POOL.  I couldn't figure how to do that, though.   Live and learn... The hard way.   Once Dextools notices a scam, do they remove it from the feed? Hate to see others start their New Year of the same as I did. 😭  👋💰🚽* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321275)

    @Katana_Crypto --- *Two apparent scams promoted on Dextools as safe:  COINBASE DAO  DISCORD DAO    If they aren't scams, why are they impossible to sell?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/321268)

    @dabbucici --- *@stanes  #1 trending on dextools is a honeypot fake COPY of HoHoHo contract please take it down* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/318577)

    @大可不必 --- *Well, because that project has been banned since its launch. But its twitter said that it had paid dext marketing to advertise the project, so I was very worried about whether it was a scam* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/322347)

15. **bot, limit bot, limit**

    @Blackbird_vlad --- *So yes the problem come from anonymous setting, the bot don't recognize anonymous admin 😭* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/319838)

    @Blackbird_vlad --- *Anyway my problem is that I added pricebot to channel, I try set pair and it keeps saying only admin can do that, but man I'm the admin so what is the problem? Is because we have set anonymous admins?* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/319829)

    @FredericDEXT --- *Maybe, you need to set the bot as admin too* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/319832)

    @RedPanda94 --- *You might have included a word that triggered a bot* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/322016)

    @JosefMarino --- *Before everything worked perfect, please put watchlist on left side, and graphic on left side you could quit, it has no importance, we want to focus on the important things, swapp and limit bot should appear there, please change that* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/318868)

    @JoeyDieleman --- *Indeed because its anonimous, the bot api doesn't show admin permissions so can't know its an admin* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/DEXToolsCommunity/319869)
