7. **land, alice, game**

    @anastasiaplane --- *Hi. Mysterious Seed is a companion game accessible from any browser. Alice’s Mysterious Seed includes three fun and intuitive mini-games where you’ll need to water the plant, play sweet tunes to it and fertilize it in order for it to grow and prosper. You will be able to plant your seed and tend to it. If you look after it, it will yield a fruit. This fruit will be valuable in My Neighbor Alice when the game is released.   Important to say that the seeds available to purchase only during limited Alice’s shop opening that we do only 3-4 times a year. Other than that you can obtain seed from Mystery Box, such as the one we will be selling during the next Winter Holiday with Alice NFT sale on Binance https://bit.ly/31xzGqK* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/426830)

    @QORPOBOSS --- *The economy is mainly driven by land purchases, buildings, and players trading the game assets with each other. There is a marketplace where anyone can create listings of their assets. For creating a listing you have to pay a fee and also pay tax for trading.  Players can make money by progressing in the game, completing side quests, joining various events, fighting in PVP, and mainly out of their own in-game businesses.  Every player that wants to spend some time on your land has to pay you a tax for doing activities on your property.  The owner of the property chooses how high are the taxes for staying on his land and using his services. This all and many more utilities are important for a token growth* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/binancenfts/421010)
