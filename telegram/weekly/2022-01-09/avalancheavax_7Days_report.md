    @Martin --- *Hey guys, I got a question regarding staking on P chain:   When I want to delegate and look at the list of validators, the fees change considerably. From about 5% up to 20%. Why is there such a variation, and how do validators choose what fee they will take? And why would anybody stake with anyone who has a 20% if there is plenty of choices for say 5-10% fee?   Yeah, i know, it was more questions than one, but I'd really like to know the mechanics of it...  Thanks in advance for any advice.* **--->** [TG Discussion](https://t.me/avalancheavax/320334)
