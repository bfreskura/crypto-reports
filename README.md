# üìú Crypto Summaries

Collection of automatically generated summaries from various crypto related Telegram groups.

With hundreds of messages generated every day in multiple crypto Telegram groups, it's often hard to find relevant info among all the noise.

That's why we are developing a tool that can automatically summarize relevant information from any crypto related Telegram group.

## üìí List of currently monitored Telegram groups

> You can suggest a new group by openning a [new issue](https://github.com/bfreskura/crypto-reports/issues) and tagging it with the `new_tg_group` tag, or by leaving a comment in our [Telegram group](https://t.me/crypto_summaries).

## ‚ùì FAQ

### How often are reports generated?

We generate reports once per day, usually around 18:00 CET.

### Can we add new Telegram groups?

Absolutely, create a new issue with the link to the Telegram group chat and we'll consider adding it to our summary report.

### Why does the quality of summaries varies so much?

Our algorithms use machine learning and statistical algorithms which aren't perfect, especially when it comes to unstructured and noisy data sources such as user chats.
It's also possible there wasn't any relevant info in the chat for the analyzed interval, but we can't detect that so the algorithms just spits out an uninformative summary.

We are constantly experimenting with various new algorithms so users can expect results to get better over time.

### What about other sources such as Discord?

Current focus is on Telegram groups, but Discord is also on our long term roadmap.

### I want you to include some cool new feature. How can I help?

Great! Open a new issue describing the feature and we'll figure out the next steps from there.
