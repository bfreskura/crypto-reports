# üìú WrapUp Summaries

Collection of automatically generated summaries from various crypto related Telegram groups and Discord servers.

With hundreds of messages generated every day in multiple crypto chats, it's often hard to find relevant info among all the noise.
That's why we are developing a tool that can automatically summarize relevant information from any crypto related Telegram group or Discord server.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### How often are reports generated?

There are 2 report types we generate:

1. Daily ones which are generated once per day, usually around 18:00 CET. Daily reports summarize chat data from the last 24 hours.

2. Weekly ones which are generated every Sunday, usually around 12:00 CET. Weekly reports summarize chat data from the last 7 days.

### Summary reports for one or more groups aren't available for some dates. Why?

This means the machine learning model didn't find any relevant information to summarize, usually because there weren't many messages sent in the observed interval.

### Can we add new Telegram groups or Discord servers?

Absolutely, create a new issue with the link to the Telegram group/Discord server and we'll consider adding it to our summary report.

### Why does the quality of summaries varies so much?

Our algorithms use machine learning and statistical algorithms which aren't perfect, especially when it comes to unstructured and noisy data sources such as user chats.
It's also possible there wasn't any relevant info in the chat for the analyzed interval, but we can't detect that so the algorithms just spits out an uninformative summary.

We are constantly experimenting with various new algorithms so users can expect results to get better over time.

### I want you to include some cool new feature. How can I help?

Great! Open a new issue describing the feature and we'll figure out the next steps from there.
