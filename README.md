# Crypto summaries

Collection of automatically generated summaries from various Crypto chats.

## FAQ

### How often are reports generated?

We generate reports once per day, usually around 17:00 CET.

### Can we add new Telegram groups?

Sure, create a new issue with the link to the Telegram group chat and we'll consider adding it to our daily summary report.

### What about other sources such as Discord?

Current focus is on Telegram groups, but Discord is also on our long term roadmap.

### Why does the quality of summaries varies so much?

Our algorithms use machine learning and statistical algorithms which aren't perfect, especially when it comes to unstructured and noisy data sources such as user chats.
It's also possible there wasn't any relevant info in the chat for the analyzed interval, but we can't detect that so the algorithms just spits out very uninformative summary.

We are constantly experimenting with various new algorithms so users can expect for results to get better over time.

### I want you to include some cool new feature. How can I help?

Great! Open a new issue describing the feature and we'll figure out the next steps there.
