    odin free --- *Hey Sempai,  With the launch of the new version, we are currently experiencing massive demand. StarkNet's capacity is still locked and therefore it can take a long time for transactions to be processed. Once the training wheels are removed, transaction time will be massively reduced. Thank you for your enthusiasm to try StarkNet in these early days. It should now get better any day/week. Have a good day.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/853954510515208192/938044033702453308)

* [2 ‚Ü©Ô∏è] *(I hope I understood the question) For example: https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/transactions.cairo#L345 `global_state_changes` is a dict of `StateEntry` structs, which in turn contain a pointer to another dict (it would have worked the same if instead of `StateEntry` you'd have a pointer directly). It works as follows: you "guess" (using a hint) the value of the main dict, compute from it the new value of the pointer, and finally call `dict_update` which verifies the guess and performs the update. Note that due to the use of a hint you won't be able to use it as-is in StarkNet contracts (but I believe that it can be fixed by using `dict_read`, `dict_write`  and a default dict).* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/937790124761182309)

    RoboTeddy --- *I haven't understood your problem carefully, but it's likely that the starknet testing library returns `-1` as `P-1`. those two values behave the same way, because e.g. `(3 + (-1)) % P == 2`, just like `(3 + (P - 1)) % P == 2`. so a couple of options ‚Äî you could either specifically test for e.g. `assert l.result == (1, P-1)`, or you could write some kind of python test wrapper that returns `-1` instead of `P-1`.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/937834308977193030)

2. **ap ap ap, assert, assert ap**

    ilya.lesokhin --- *Maybe not well defined wasn't the best way of phrasing it. The generated code is deterministic.  but assert [ap] = [ap-1] * [ap-1] * [ap-1] Asks the compiler  to assign a value to [ap] and the compiler also uses [ap] as temporary storage for the computation of the  [ap-1] * [ap-1] * [ap-1] compound expression.

* [2 ‚Ü©Ô∏è] *Hey guys, I need some help. I got really frustrated after a few days of trying. I already report a bug on github and I made another post here. The problem is using starknet js to interact with cairo contracts that have a Uint256 parameter.   I created a repo on github with a simple ERC20 deployment script that fail. https://github.com/FilipLaurentiu/starknet_js_interaction Argent X use the starknet js library to interact with ERC20 tokens and I thought that maybe I use it wrong on any other problem...
