    guthl | StarkWare --- *In Cairo, finding an element in a list knowing it is in the list should be o(1) Not sure how to implement it though* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/937529551540600903)

    RoboTeddy --- *if you're searching for the end of a list, you might be able to do better than O(n) btw — could do something akin to a binary search to find the end!* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/937509519301439578)

2. **contract, little, network doesn connect**

    Julien | argent.xyz --- *You should ask questions related to Argent X on the <#908663762150645770> channel. But you are probably seing that screen because you are trying to create a wallet on the local testnet network... which doesn't seem to be there. You should connect to Goerli or Mainnet instead.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/937726046994837564)

    Monkstep --- *Hello everyone! Sorry if this has been asked a million times, but I'm a dapp dev looking to try get involved with smart contract development on StarkNet. IIRC it was in closed beta, is this still the case? Is there a place I could go to sign up?* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/937511518000521308)
