1. *Sure:  Matic's protocol sought to solve scalability.  They chose to do this by allowing each validator to author a large number of blocks in a row.  During a session, no other validator can propose a different block.  This is generally considered a very bad idea in literally any protocol.  MATIC did it because they thought they were being clever by reducing collisions (when more than 1 block is proposed at the same time).  Good protocols are designed to absorb collisions...but this does take some significant software engineering wizardry and very complex mathematical proofs to define security arguments.  MATIC opted to skip this step and produce what could be described as a fully centralized protocol (in that 1 validator owns the network for significant periods of time).  Currently, 1 validator is contributing almost entirely empty blocks.  That validator controls 23% of the total stake on the network.  MATIC is getting wrecked by a validator.  Both the MATIC staff and community are blaming a game.* **--->** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/635865020172861441/847768728166989825/928389654288424970)
