* [2 ↩️] *Hey guys ! I'm already using the OpenZeppelin's Cairo contracts for my ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, but I didn't find any discussions about an OpenZeppelin Cairo implementation of ERC1155. Should I create my own ERC1155 implementation from scratch, or there's already some ressources about it?* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/936556820389052426)

* [2 ↩️] *testnet. for me it was also working from time to time. Situation improved after increasing `CHECK_STATUS_TIMEOUT` from `@shardlabs/starknet-hardhat-plugin/dist/constants`. <@!767746468542283827>* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/936339220744790026)

### 🔝 **Topics and related messages**

1. **testing, transaction, testing framework**

    Julien | argent.xyz --- *<@!208960037308071937> already replied but I can confirm that you have access to events in the testing framework* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/936539181277143070)

    cecco_ --- *You should also be able to get _all_ events from the starknet state object https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/64a7f6aed9757d3d8d6c28bd972df73272b0cb0a/src/starkware/starknet/testing/state.py#L173* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/936357373247893584)

    cecco_ --- *I haven't updated my code yet so I'm not 100% sure, but it looks like the transaction execution object contains the emitted events https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/64a7f6aed9757d3d8d6c28bd972df73272b0cb0a/src/starkware/starknet/business_logic/transaction_execution_objects.py#L212* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/936357256784666704)

2. **add, make connection snippet, wait fees implemented**

    max wolff --- *i read that section already, describes memory layout but cant make the connection to this snippet. could you say more? what does segments add in the hint mean?* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/936501148729352203)

    RoboTeddy --- *(Mainly though, segments are behind the scenes and you don't need to worry about them as an end-user of Cairo. the bit of code you screenshotted is a hint — if you're using starknet, it's not actually possible for you to add additional hints)* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/936498594243039232)

    th0rgal --- *So that we can use the same mechanism* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128844/936322395680178248)
