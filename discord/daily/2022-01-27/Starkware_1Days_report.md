* [2 ‚Ü©Ô∏è] *in cairo you only have values in the range [0,p-1], integers in the range [(p-1)/2,p-1] are "treated as" negative.  to use the number properly in python code you can use the as_int helper, example; https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/cairo/common/math.cairo#L298* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/936284630695411862)

1. **rust, pretty, think**

    Verde --- *I'd love to work in a project like that, I want to work on my Rust* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/936235709260517466)

    milan --- *fwiw, I welcome the move to a more Rusty environment, my thesis is that Rust is eating blockchain dev, it's popping up everywhere, Rust's adoption among blockchain and smart contract engineers will only grow, so it's a reasonable choice* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/936166675752042548)

2. **felt, value, distance**

    wraitii --- *I'm not certain it's much better than checking for 0-valued felt, but it works if you want to store arbitrary-length data neatly* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/936312470920912916)

    wraitii --- *So you can just store 31 characters, then a 0/1 to mark the end of the string or not, and it's completely transparent as an array of felt* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/936311491534151750)

    wraitii --- *I've made a 'long string' system by storing a 0 / 1 in the LSB* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/936311244657393815)

3. **legal, computation, positions**

    ilya.lesokhin --- *To prove a Cairo run the memory need to be continuous, with no gaps between the addresses. But making the memory continuous when you don't know the size of each segment is difficult. Our solution is to allow the runner to use (segment number, segment_offset) pairs rather than the field elements for addresses. Once the run is complete we know the sizes of the segments, we assign an absolution address (a field element) to each segment and replace every (segment number, segment_offset) pair with a field element to create a provable run. https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/64a7f6aed9757d3d8d6c28bd972df73272b0cb0a/src/starkware/cairo/lang/vm/cairo_runner.py#L328* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/936161738330624040)

    FeedTheFed | StarkWare --- *hhmmm which computation? verification if a move is legal? I don't think you should go over all legal moves, but just check that a given move was legal (if you're writing Cairo rather than a StarkNet contract then you have hints available, so you can get a hint if e.g. you're in check and what piece is causing it, and then verify it in Cairo). Other than checks you just need to know that the position the piece moved to is empty, and that the path was clear (e.g. if it's a rook move then I have at most 6 positions that I need to verify are empty).* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/936001562759790622)

    FeedTheFed | StarkWare --- *IIUC the vm first executes the program without outputs (just collects them), and then decides in retrospect the start location of output_ptr (and also the end since it collected all the intermediate values sent to the output).  Re halting condition, I think that in the playground the vm just runs until pc reaches a certain address as you suggested (something along the lines of https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/64a7f6aed9757d3d8d6c28bd972df73272b0cb0a/src/starkware/cairo/lang/vm/cairo_runner.py#L278) When actually proving the execution of Cairo programs the start_pc, end_pc, and #steps are part of the proven statement (definition 2 in the paper).  tagging <@!825258293266087937> who will know more* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/936000464493883412)

    odin free --- *Hey anon, good point. With the launch of the new version, we are currently experiencing massive demand. StarkNet's capacity is still locked and therefore it can take a long time for transactions to be processed. Once the training wheels are removed, transaction time will be massively reduced. Thank you for your enthusiasm to try StarkNet in these early days. It should now get better any day/week. Have a good day.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/853954510515208192/936235409158053888)
