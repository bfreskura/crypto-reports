1. *No, I got banned because one of the developers in the community claimed there had been another fork and I asked for clarity.  The mod who banned did not document it, and deleted the convo.  Aman is aware, and he knows that my alt is here.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/635865020172861441/847768728166989825/928929090604507156)

2. *Here's the data: 29.2% of blocks mined in the last 24 hours are by good actors (from a user experience standpoint), 50.5% by bad actors. I only looked at the top 80% of validators.  Bad Actors: 20% of blocks; BAD ACTOR 0x7b5000af8ab69fd59eb0d4f5762bff57c9c04385 Target 15m gas limit; makes empty blocks These three addresses are all owned by the same group; they‚Äôre not three independent validators, so they really account for 20.3% of all blocks:  - Group 8.5% of blocks; BAD ACTOR 0x26c80cc193b27d73d2c40943acec77f4da2c5bd8 Target 15m gas limit  - Group 7.4% of blocks; BAD ACTOR 0xe7e2cb8c81c10ff191a73fe266788c9ce62ec754 Target 15m gas limit  - Group 4.4% of blocks; BAD ACTOR 0xbdbd4347b082d9d6bdf2da4555a37ce52a2e2120 Target 15m gas limit Produces empty blocks 4.3% of blocks; BAD ACTOR 0xb79fad4ca981472442f53d16365fdf0305ffd8e9 Target 15m gas limit 3.2% of blocks; BAD ACTOR address/0x742d13f0b2a19c823bdd362b16305e4704b97a38 MANY empty blocks; not mined for 7 hours 2.7% of blocks; BAD ACTOR 0xbc6044f4a1688d8b8596a9f7d4659e09985eebe6 Some empty blocks; not mined for 10 hours  Good actors: 13% of blocks 0x7c7379531b2aee82e4ca06d4175d13b9cbeafd49 9.8% of blocks 0xf0245f6251bef9447a08766b9da2b07b28ad80b0 3.3% of blocks 0x4f856f79f54592a48c8a1a1fafa1b0a3ac053f99 3.1% of blocks 0xc6869257205e20c2a43cb31345db534aecb49f6e 5% of blocks 0xb95d435df3f8b2a8d8b9c2b7c8766c9ae6ed8cc9 Not mined for 20 hrs* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/635865020172861441/847768728166989825/928746133596024902)

3. *In addition to the block competition issue, there's also an economic mismatch between validators and users going on. Looks like the majority of validators (ones who have mined more than 50.5% of blocks in the last 24 hours) have identified that higher gas prices are very good for their business, so they're actively working to (a) lower the block gas limit while they're mining, and (b) drop blocks and extend their block times.   Solving the competition issue would also mitigate this mismatch; if validators compete, and one thing they're competing on is block time and block size, then only validators with high throughput would be successful at creating blocks.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/635865020172861441/847768728166989825/928742889792626698)

I believe that unless the government starts a new stimulus program, which in the end will piss off people because it creates more inflation with more dollars in the market; The fed doesn't stop the interest rate increase speech; more countries start accepting BTC or crypto; the negative ESG narrative towards proof of work dies off, which I doubt because people can believe that BTC is hogging all the power and causing power prices to go up, etc, that we are pretty much in the beginning of a bear market.

### üîù **Topics and related messages**

1. **ban, rivalry, make sure**

    AlgoRhythm --- *Either of you care if we unban Post Capone?  He‚Äôs back, so not much different if he‚Äôs on his main or alt account.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/635865020172861441/839057894154043423/928787452221616189)

    AlgoRhythm --- *Wow, interesting. He‚Äôs on the ban list, but I didn‚Äôt ban him either. I didn‚Äôt know if one of you finally got fed up with him üòõ.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/635865020172861441/839057894154043423/928743407474577450)

    Stake | StakePool --- *Even though he's been doing FUD all the time. I didn't make any bans. Bad intentioned people just want attention. I've never seen a post from him before praising protocol.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/635865020172861441/839057894154043423/928740179844411493)

2. **faucet, fail, going**

    AlgoRhythm --- *Faucet is back up, and I'll keep an eye on it if I missed anything they're exploiting. Below are the checks in place: * User can request between 0.05 and 0.15 Matic * If either the User or the Wallet has received more than 0.2 Matic, it will fail (before the User check was broken) * If the address has more than 0.3, it will fail * If the address has 0 transactions, it will fail (What are they going to swap if they have 0 funds?) * And then obviously if the address is invalid or the faucet is dry, fail* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/635865020172861441/839057894154043423/929069143393730610)

    AlgoRhythm --- *If the checks are working, it should limit them to .3 Matic (2 faucet calls) for all time.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/635865020172861441/839057894154043423/928747855122944030)

    Stake | StakePool --- *Limit once a day! The bot faucet is to help with the initial transaction. Then the user can use that amount to make their first transaction into a dex where they can buy their own matic gas.* **&rarr;** [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/635865020172861441/839057894154043423/928745491993341953)
